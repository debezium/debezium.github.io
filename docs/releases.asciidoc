All notable changes for Debezium releases are documented in this file.
Release numbers follow http://semver.org[Semantic Versioning].

[[release-0-8-0-beta-1]]
== *Release 0.8.0.Beta1* _(June 21st, 2018)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12337217[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.1.0 and has been tested with version 1.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.8.0.Beta1 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.8.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.8.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

Topic names for heartbeat messages followed a hard-coded naming schema.
The rules were made more flexible in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-668[DBZ-668].

Transaction id (`txId` field of `Envelope`) for PostgreSQL was originally encoded as an 32-bit `integer` type.
The real range is a 64-bit `long` type so this was changed in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-673[DBZ-673].

The datatypes without timezone were not correctly offsetted for databases running in non-UTC timezones.
This was fixed in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-578[DBZ-587] and https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-741[DBZ-741].
See link:docs/connectors/mysql/#temporal-values[MySQL] and link:docs/connectors/postgresql/#temporal-values[PostgreSQL] connector documentation for further details.

[[release-0-7-5]]
== *Release 0.7.5* _(March 20th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12337159[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.1 and has been tested with version 1.0.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.5 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.5 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.5 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The MySQL connector in Debezium 0.7.3 and 0.7.4 was creating database history topic with an infinite time-based log retention but a broker default one for topic size log retention.
This was fixed in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-663[DBZ-663].
See our http://debezium.io/blog/2018/03/16/note-on-database-history-topic-configuration/[blogpost] for more details,
in particular how you should adjust your database history topic configuration, if you're affected by this issue.

MySQL snapshot JMX metrics were removed after the snapshot was completed.
This was changed in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-640[DBZ-640] and the metrics are available till next connector restart.

=== New Features

This release includes the following new features:

* Keep SnapshotReaderMetrics bean registered after snapshot completed https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-640[DBZ-640]
* Cache replaced topic names and shard ids in ByLogicalTableRouter SMT https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-655[DBZ-655]
* Filter out useless commands from the history topic https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-661[DBZ-661]
* Apache Kafka 1.0.1 updates https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-647[DBZ-647]

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes:

* io.debezium.text.ParsingException for TokuDB table https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-646[DBZ-646]
* MongoDB connector continues to try to connect to invalid host even after deletion https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-648[DBZ-648]
* Streaming stopped due to JsonParseException https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-657[DBZ-657]
* 'ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE KEY key_name (colname)' throwing exception https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-660[DBZ-660]
* Missing setting for the automatic history topic creation https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-663[DBZ-663]
* EmbeddedEngine passes time of last commit to policy, not time since https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-665[DBZ-665]

=== Other changes

This release includes also other changes:

* Describe limitations of wal2json version currently used on RDS https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-619[DBZ-619]

[[release-0-7-4]]
== *Release 0.7.4* _(March 7th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12336214[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.0 and has been tested with version 1.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.4 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.4 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.4 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

`NUMERIC` and geo-spatial schema types were optional regardless of database column configuration. This was fixed in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-635[DBZ-635].

PostgresSQL decoder plug-in now uses text to transfer decimal values instead of double - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-351[DBZ-351].
Debezium is backward compatible with the old version.
It is thus necessary first to upgrade Debezium and after that upgrade logical decoder plug-in.

* Document VariableScaleDecimal in PG connector docs https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-631[DBZ-631]
* Propagate schema validator by passing AvroValidator instance instead of Function<String, String> https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-626[DBZ-626]
* Move MAX_QUEUE_SIZE, MAX_BATCH_SIZE and POLL_INTERVAL_MS to CommonConnectorConfig https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-628[DBZ-628]
* Unify common start-up logic across connectors https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-630[DBZ-630]
* Removing unused code from database history classes https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-632[DBZ-632]

=== Breaking changes

A new namespace for parameters was https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-576[created] - `internal` - that is used for parameters that are not documented and should not be used as they are subject of changes without warning.
As a result of this change the undocumented parameter `database.history.ddl.filter` was renamed to `internal.database.history.ddl.filter`.

OpenShift deployment now uses templates and images from [Strimzi project](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-545).

[[release-0-7-0]]
== *Release 0.7.0* _(December 15th, 2017)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12335366&projectId=12317320[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.0 and has been tested with version 1.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.0 from any of the earlier 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.0 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.0 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes the following changes that can affect existing installations:

* Change default setting for BIGINT UNSIGNED handling https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-461[DBZ-461];
`UNSIGNED BIGINT` is treated by default as `int64`, not as `Decimal` before. Set `bigint.unsigned.handling.mode` if you need to continue with the original behaviour.
* Invalid value for HourOfDay ConnectException when the value of MySQL TIME filed is above 23:59:59 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-342[DBZ-342]; The default mapping for MySQL TIME(0-3) columns has changed. Such columns can store values from -838:59:59.000000 to 838:59:59.000000, which cannot be stored as milliseconds in an int32 field (the previous default mapping).
Hence the default mapping has changed to int64 and the semantic type io.debezium.time.MicroTime, i.e. values represent microseconds. +
If you prefer to keep the previous mapping (which only should be done if it's guaranteed that no values are stored in that column whose milliseconds value exceeds int32), you can do so by specifying the connector option time.precision.mode=adaptive (see the connector documentation for further details). +
This change does not affect other connectors.
* Postgres connectors stops to work after concurrent schema changes and updates https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-379[DBZ-379]; PostgreSQL connector was using JDBC metadata to get additional type information when it was processing logical events.
This could lead to a race condition when database schema was updated and Debezium was still processing events with old schema structure. +
To mitigate the problem a new version of https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs[Protocol Buffers decoder plugin] was introduced that passes additional type metadata with each event.
The connector is backward compatible with the old decoder plugin (using the original approach) but we strongly recommend to upgrade it to the latest one as soon as possible. +
The race condition issue can still happen when primary key structure is changed for the table as this information is still obtained from JDBC metadata.
To properly handle primary key change you should follow the rules
** Application should be placed in a _read-only_ mode, not writing any new data actively
** PostgreSQL connector must consume all remaining events from the database
** Primary key change is executed
** Application can switch back to regular mode
* Hardcoded schema version overrides schema registry version https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-466[DBZ-466]; The schema version returned for CDC message values (schema type dbserver1.inventory.customers.Envelope) has changed. While always `1` was returned in earlier versions, the schema version as managed by the schema registry will be returned in case the Avro serializer/deserializer is used. `Null` will be returned when using the JSON serializer/deserializer. Note that the schema version is only set during Avro message serialization, i.e. an SMT applied on the source side will also get null when querying for the schema version, as SMTs will be applied before the serialization.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes the following change that affects existing installations that capture MongoDB:

* Add support for different MongoDB id types in key struct https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-306[DBZ-306];
the key payload continues to be a string in all cases, but it will be created using MongoDB's extended JSON serialization (strict mode).
So e.g. an int key will result in a key payload such as `{ "id" : "1234" }`, a String key will yield `{ "id" : "\"1234\"" }` and an `ObjectId` key will yield `{ "id" : "{\"$oid\" : \"596e275826f08b2730779e1f\"}" }`.
This allows to restore the key into the correct type from the serialized representation.
Note that the id field has been renamed from "_id" into "id".
This is to be consistent with the format used by the other Debezium connectors;
also it allows you to tell apart messages written by earlier Debezium versions from messages written by 0.6 and beyond.

=== New Features

* Use new Kafka 0.10 properties for listeners and advertised listeners https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-39[DBZ-39]

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12334135[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 0.10.2.0 and has been tested with version 0.10.2.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.5.1 from any of the earlier 0.4.1, 0.4.0, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.5.0 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.5.1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

[[release-0-3-5]]
== *Release 0.3.5* _(November 9, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12332052[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release requires Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.x due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details, and Kafka documentation for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

*We strongly urge all users to upgrade to this release from earlier versions.* In prior versions, the MySQL connector may stop without completing all updates in a transaction, and when the connector restarts it starts with the _next_ transaction and therefore might fail to capture some of the change events in the earlier transaction. This release fixes this issue so that when restarting it will always pick up where it left off, even if that point is in the middle of a transaction. Note that this fix only takes affect once a connector is upgraded and restarted. Also, this fix does not affect or alter the content of change events produced by the connector. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-144[the issue] for more details.

Before upgrading the MySQL connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.3.5 from 0.3.4, 0.3.3, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, 0.3.0, 0.2.4, 0.2.3, 0.2.2, or 0.2.1, gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.3.5 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.3.5 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release has no backward-incompatible changes since the link:release-0-3-4[0.3.4] release.

=== New Features

* MySQL connector now supports failover to MySQL masters that are slaves of _multiple_ other MySQL servers/clusters, as long as the new MySQL master has all of the transactions (as specified by GTID sets) the connector had previously seen. The connector can be configured to include or exclude particular GTID sources. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-143[DBZ-143]

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes to the link:release-0-3-4[0.3.4] release:

* Restarting MySQL connector will no longer lose or miss events from the previous transaction that was incompletely processed prior to the easlier shutdown. The content of change events are unaffected. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-144[DBZ-144]
* Shutting down MySQL connector task database and quickly terminating the Kafka Connect process may cause connector to be restarted in a strange state when Kafka Connect is restarted, but this no longer results in a null pointer exception in the Kafka database history. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-146[DBZ-146]
* MySQL connector now has option to treat `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` columns as double values rather than `java.math.BigDecimal` values that are encoded in the messages by Kafka Connect in binary form. This option may result in lost precision, but makes the values far easier for consumers to work with them. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-147[DBZ-147]
* MySQL connector tests now take into account daylight savings time in the expected results. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-148[DBZ-148]
* MySQL connector now properly treats `BINARY` columns as binary values rather than string values. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-149[DBZ-149]
* MySQL connector now handles updates to a row's primary/unique key by issuing `DELETE` and tombstone events for the row with the old key, and then an `INSERT` event for the row with the new key. Previously, the `INSERT` was emitted before the `DELETE`. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-150[DBZ-150]
* MySQL connector now handles `ENUM` and `SET` literals with parentheses. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-153[DBZ-153]



[[release-0-3-4]]
== *Release 0.3.4* _(October 25, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12331604[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release requires Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.x due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details, and Kafka documentation for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.3.4 from 0.3.3, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, 0.3.0, 0.2.4, 0.2.3, 0.2.2, or 0.2.1, gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.3.4 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.3.4 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release has one breaking changes since the link:release-0-3-3[0.3.3] release:

* MySQL connector produced change events with a `ts_sec` field that now shows correct timestamp in seconds past epoch as found from the MySQL server events. In previous releases the last 3 digits in this field were truncated. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-139[DBZ-139]

=== New Features

* MySQL connector has a new `SCHEMA_ONLY` snapshot mode. When the connector starts up for the first time and uses this snapshot mode, the connector captures the current table schemas without reading any data, and then proceeds to read the binlog. The resulting change event streams do not have all the data in the databases, but do include those change events that occurred after the snapshot started. This may be useful for consumers that only need to know the changes since the connector was started. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-133[DBZ-133]
* MySQL connector supports the MySQL `JSON` datatype. These JSON values are represented as STRING values in the change events, although the name of the field's Kafka Connect schema is `io.debezium.data.Json` to signal to consumers that the string value is actually a JSON document, array, or scalar. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-126[DBZ-126]
* MySQL connector metrics are exposed via JMX. All of the Debezium Docker images can expose the JMX data via a custom port. See the link:/docs/monitoring[Monitoring Debezium] document for more details. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-134[DBZ-134]

* MySQL connector has improved output of GTIDs and status when reading the binary log. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-130[DBZ-130], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-131[DBZ-131]
* MySQL connector properly handles multi-character `ENUM` and `SET` values. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-132[DBZ-132]



[[release-0-3-2]]
== *Release 0.3.2* _(September 26, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12331401[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release requires Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.x due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details, and Kafka documentation for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.3.2 from 0.3.1, 0.3.0, 0.2.4, 0.2.3, 0.2.2, or 0.2.1, gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.3.2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.3.2 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes no breaking changes since the link:release-0-3-1[0.3.1] release.

=== New Features

This release includes no new features since the link:release-0-3-1[0.3.1] release.

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes to the link:release-0-3-1[0.3.1] release:

* MySQL connector now handles zero-value dates. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-114[DBZ-114]
* MySQL connector no longer prints out password-related configuration properties, though https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4171[KAFKA-4171] for a similar issue with Kafka Connect. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-122[DBZ-122]
* MySQL connector no longer causes "Error registering AppInfo mbean" warning in Kafka Connect. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-124[DBZ-124]
* MySQL connector periodically outputs status when reading binlog. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-116[DBZ-116]
* MongoDB connector periodically outputs status when reading binlog. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-117[DBZ-117]
* MySQL connector correctly uses long for the `server.id` configuration property. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-118[DBZ-118]
* MySQL connector fails or warns when MySQL is not using row-level logging. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-128[DBZ-128]

Upon restart, the 0.3.1 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes no breaking changes compared to the link:release-0-3-0[0.3.0] release.

=== New Features

* Added support for secure (encrypted) connections to MySQL. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-99[DBZ-99]

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes to the link:release-0-3-0[0.3.0] release:

* MySQL connector now properly decodes string values from the binlog based upon the column's character set encoding as read by the DDL statement. Upon upgrade and restart, the connector will re-read the recorded database history and now associate the columns with their the character sets, and any newly processed events will use properly encoded strings values. As expected, previously generated events are never altered. Force a snapshot to regenerate events for the servers. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-102[DBZ-102]
* Corrected how the MySQL connector parses some DDL statements. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-106[DBZ-106]
* Corrected the MySQL connector to handle MySQL server GTID sets with newline characters. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-107[DBZ-107], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-111[DBZ-111]
* Corrected the MySQL connector's startup logic properly compare the MySQL SSL-related system properties to prevent overwriting them. The connector no longer fails when the system properties are the same, which can happen upon restart or starting a second MySQL connector with the same keystore. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-112[DBZ-112]
* Removed unused code and test case. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-108[DBZ-108]
* Ensure that the MySQL error code and SQLSTATE are included in exceptions reported by the connector. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-109[DBZ-109]

== *Release 0.3.0* _(August 16, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12329661[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release requires Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.x due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details, and Kafka documentation for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.3.0 from 0.2.4, 0.2.3, 0.2.2, or 0.2.1, gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.3.0 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.3.0 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes one potentially breaking changes from the link:release-0-2-4[0.2.4] release:

* By default the MySQL connector now represents temporal values with millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision based upon the precision of the source database columns. This changes the schema name of these fields to Debezium-specific constants, and the meaning/interpretation of the literal values now depends on this schema name. To enable previous behavior that always used millisecond precision using only Kafka Connect logical types, set `time.precision.mode` connector property to `connect`. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-91[DBZ-91]

=== New Features

* Added the link:/docs/connectors/mongodb[MongoDB connector], which can capture and record the changes within a MongoDB replica set or MongoDB sharded cluster. In the latter case, the connector even automatically handles the addition or removal of shards. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-2[DBZ-2]

=== Fixes

This release includes all of the fixes from the link:release-0-2-4[0.2.4] release, and also includes the following fixes:

* Corrected how the MySQL connector handles `TINYINT` columns. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-84[DBZ-84]
* MySQL snapshots records DDL statements as separate events on the schema change topic. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-97[DBZ-97]
* MySQL connector tolerates binlog filename missing from ROTATE events in certain situations. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-95[DBZ-95]
* The Kafka Connect schema names used in the MySQL connector's change events are now always Avro-compatible schema names. Now, using the Avro converter with a `database.server.name` value, database names, or table names that contain Avro-incompatible characters produce log warnings but no longer result in errors during serialization and Avro schema generation. Whenever possible, use a `database.server.name` value that contains alphanumeric and underscore characters. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-86[DBZ-86]



[[release-0-2-4]]
== *Release 0.2.4* _(August 16, 2016)_

August 16, 2016 - https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12331221[Detailed release notes]

[[release-0-2-2]]
== *Release 0.2.2* _(June 22, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12330862[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release can be used with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.10.0 due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details.

=== Upgrading

Check the backward-incompatible changes when upgrading to 0.2.2 from 0.2.1 or 0.2.0.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.2.2 from 0.2.1 or 0.2.0, gracefully stop the running 0.2.1 connector, remove the 0.2.1 plugin files, install the 0.2.2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.2.2 connector will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.


=== Backwards-incompatible changes

* Removed several methods in the `GtidSet` class inside the MySQL connector. The class was introduced in 0.2. This change will only affect applications explicitly using the class (by reusing the MySQL connector JAR), and will not affect how the MySQL connector works. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-79[DBZ-79]
* The `source` field within each MySQL change event now contains the binlog position of that event (rather than the next event). The structure of the change events (and semantics of other values remain) the same as with 0.2.1. Note that this change _may_ adversely clients that are explicitly comparing the position values across multiple events. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-71[DBZ-71]

=== Fixes

This release includes all of the fixes from the link:release-0-2-1[0.2.1] release plus the following fixes:

* Correct how the MySQL connector records offsets with multi-row MySQL events so that, even if the connector experiences a non-graceful shutdown (i.e., crash) after committing the offset of _some_ of the rows from such an event, upon restart the connector will resume with the remaining rows in that multi-row event. Previously, the connector might incorrectly restart at the next event. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-73[DBZ-73]
* Shutdown of the MySQL connector immediately after a snapshot completes (before another change event is reccorded) will now be properly marked as complete. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-77[DBZ-77]


[[release-0-2-1]]
== *Release 0.2.1* _(June 10, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12330752[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release can be used with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.10.0 due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80]

=== Upgrading

Check the backward-incompatible changes when upgrading to 0.2.1 from 0.2.0.

When you decide to upgrade the MySQL connector to 0.2.1 from 0.2.0, gracefully stop the running 0.2.0 connector, remove the 0.2.0 plugin files, install the 0.2.1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.2.1 connector will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Backwards-incompatible changes

* Corrected the names of the Avro-compliant Kafka Connect schemas generated by the MySQL connector for the `before` and `after` fields in its data change events. Consumers that require knowledge (by name) of the particular schemas used in 0.2 events may have trouble consuming events produced by the 0.2.1 (or later) connector. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-72[DBZ-72]

=== Fixes

This release includes all of the fixes from the link:release-0-2-0[0.2.0] release plus the following fixes:

* The MySQL connector's plugin archive now contains the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file required by the connector. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-71[DBZ-71]



[[release-0-2-0]]
== *Release 0.2.0* _(June 8, 2016)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12329465[complete list of issues] addressed in this release.

[WARNING]
====
The 0.2.0 release contained a significant issue, and link:#release-0-2-1[0.2.1] was quickly released to fix the problem. We recommend using a newer release than 0.2.
====

=== Backwards-incompatible changes

* Completely redesigned the structure of event messages produced by MySQL connector and stored in Kafka topics. Events now contain an _envelope_ structure with information about the source event, the kind of operation (create/insert, update, delete, read), the time that Debezium processed the event, and the state of the row before and/or after the event. The messages written to each topic have a distinct Avro-compliant Kafka Connect schema that reflects the structure of the source table, which may vary over time independently from the schemas of all other topics. See the http://debezium.io/docs/connectors/mysql#events[documentation] for details. This envelope structure will likely be used by future connectors. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-50[DBZ-50], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-52[DBZ-52], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-45[DBZ-45], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-60[DBZ-60]
* MySQL connector handles deletion of a row by recording a delete event message whose value contains the state of the removed row (and other metadata), followed by a _tombstone event_ message with a null value to signal *Kafka's log compaction* that all messages with the same key can be garbage collected. See the http://debezium.io/docs/connectors/mysql#events[documentation] for details. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-44[DBZ-44]
* Changed the format of events that the MySQL connector writes to its schema change topic, through which consumers can access events with the DDL statements applied to the database(s). The format change makes it possible for consumers to correlate these events with the data change events. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-43[DBZ-43], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-55[DBZ-55]

=== New features

* MySQL connector supports *high availability* MySQL cluster topologies. See the http://debezium.io/docs/connectors/mysql[documentation] for details. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-37[DBZ-37]
* MySQL connector now by default starts by performing a *consistent snapshot* of the schema and contents of the upstream MySQL databases in its current state. See the http://debezium.io/docs/connectors/mysql#snapshots[documentation] for details about how this works and how it impacts other database clients. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-31[DBZ-31]
* MySQL connector can be configured to *exclude*, *truncate*, or *mask* specific columns in events. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-29[DBZ-29]
* MySQL connector events can be serialized using the http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/avro.html[Confluent Avro converter] or the JSON converter. Previously, only the JSON converter could be used. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-29[DBZ-29], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-63[DBZ-63], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-64[DBZ-64]

=== Changes

* DDL parsing framework identifies table affected by statements via a new listener callback. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-38[DBZ-38]
* The `database.binlog` configuration property was required in version 0.1 of the MySQL connector, but now it is no longer used because of the new snapshot feature. If provided, it will be quietly ignored. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-31[DBZ-31]

=== Bug fixes

* MySQL connector now properly parses `COMMIT` statements, the `REFERENCES` clauses of `CREATE TABLE` statements, and statements with `CHARSET` shorthand of `CHARACTER SET`. https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-48[DBZ-48], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-49[DBZ-49], https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-57[DBZ-57]
* MySQL connector properly handles binary values that are hexadecimal strings https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-61[DBZ-61]
