This release includes a variety of new changes and improvements across various connectors like MongoDB, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, Vitess, and the Kubernetes Operator, to a myriad of subtle fixes and improvements across the entire Debezium portfolio. Let&#8217;s take a moment and dive into some highlights&#8230;&#8203;</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p></p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The team aims to avoid any potential breaking changes between minor releases; however, such changes are sometimes inevitable.</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">Core</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>It was identified that certain JDBC queries could indefinitely block in the case of certain communication failures. To combat this problem, a new configurable timeout option, <code>query.timeout.ms</code> is available to set the maximum time that a JDBC query can execute before being terminated (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7616">DBZ-7616</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">SQL Server</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The SQL Server connector previously processed all transactions captured during a single database round trip. This behavior is configurable and is based on <code>max.iterations.transactions</code>, which defaults to processing all transactions (value of <code>0</code>). This could lead to unexpected out of memory conditions if your database has a high volume of transactions.<br> <br> To address this for these use cases, the default value for <code>max.iterations.transactions</code> has changed to <code>500</code>, to be more resilient for these deployment use cases out-of-the-box. If you want to return to the previous behavior, simply add this configuration option to your connector with a value of <code>0</code> (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7750">DBZ-7750</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="new-features-and-improvements">New features and improvements</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.7.0.Alpha1 also introduces many improvements and features, lets take a look at each individually.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="install_debezium_operator_with_helm_chart">Install Debezium Operator with Helm Chart</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To improve the deployment of the Debezium Operator, it can be installed with a helm chart at <a href="https://charts.debezium.io" class="bare">https://charts.debezium.io</a>. This avoids the overly complicated deployment model of installing the operator into separate namespaces, minimizing the complexities for managing multiple Debezium Server deployments on Kubernetes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="support_predicate_conditions_for_mongodb_incremental_snapshots">Support predicate conditions for MongoDB incremental snapshots</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The incremental snapshot process is an instrumental part in various recovery situations to collect whole or part of the data set from a source table or collection. Relational connectors have long supported the idea of supplying an <code>additional-conditions</code> value on the incremental snapshot signal to restrict the data set, providing for targeted resynchronization of specific rows of data.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;re happy to announce that this is now possible with MongoDB (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7138">DBZ-7138</a>). Unlike relational databases, the <code>additional-conditions</code> should be supplied in JSON format. It will be applied to the specified collection using the <code>find</code> operation to obtain the subset list of documents that are to be incrementally snapshotted.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="new_mariadb_standalone_connector">New MariaDB standalone connector</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5 introduced official support for MariaDB as part of the existing MySQL connector. The next step in that evolution is here, with a new standalone connector implementation for MariaDB (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7693">DBZ-7693</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are few things worth noting here:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>MariaDB and MySQL both have a common shared dependency on a new abstract connector called <code>debezium-connector-binlog</code>, which provides the common framework for both binlog-based connectors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each standalone connector now specifically is tailored only to its target database, so MySQL users should use MySQL and MariaDB users should use MariaDB. As a result, the <code>connection.adapter</code> configuration option has been removed, and the <code>jdbc.protocol</code> configuration option is now only specific to certain MySQL use cases and not used by MariaDB.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The documentation for this connector is still a work-in-progress and will be added in the future. For the moment, you can refer to the MySQL connector documentation for most things related to MariaDB.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="extractnewdocumentstate_includes_document_id_for_mongodb_deletes">ExtractNewDocumentState includes document id for MongoDB deletes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In prior release of the MongoDB <code>ExtractNewDocumentState</code> single message transformation, a delete event did not provide the identifier as part of the payload. This reduced the meaningfulness of delete events as consumers were supplied with insufficient data to act on these events. This behavior has been improved, and the delete event now includes an <code>_id</code> attribute in the payload (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7695">DBZ-7695</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="transaction_metadata_encoded_ordering">Transaction metadata encoded ordering</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In some pipelines, ordering is critical for consuming applications. There are certain scenarios that can impact this aspect of your data pipeline, such as when Kafka re-partition occur. This leads to problems that can be error-prone trying to reconstruct the ordering after-the-fact.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now when Transaction Metadata is enabled, these metadata events will also encode their transaction order, so that in the event that a Kafka re-partition or other scenarios occur that alter the ordering semantics, consumers can simply use the new encoded ordering field instead for deterministic ordering of transactions (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7698">DBZ-7698</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="blocking_incremental_snapshot_improvements">Blocking incremental snapshot improvements</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are some use cases where incremental snapshot signals require escaping certain characters in the fully-qualified table name. This caused some problems with blocking snapshots because the process to resolve what tables to snapshot used a slightly different mechanism. In Debezium 2.7, we&#8217;ve unified this approach, and you can now use escaped table names with blocking snapshots where applicable (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7718">DBZ-7718</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="cassandra_performance_improvement">Cassandra performance improvement</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Cassandra connector also saw some changes in Debezium 2.7, specifically to performance optimizations. The implementation of the <code>KafkaRecordEmitter</code> relied on a thread-synchronization block that reduced the throughput. In addition, the implementation also performed some unnecessary flushing which also impacted performance. This code has been rewritten to improve both throughput and reduce the unnecessary flush calls (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7722">DBZ-7722</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="new_oracle_rawtostring_custom_converter">New Oracle "RawToString" custom converter</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While Oracle recommends that users avoid using <code>RAW</code>-based columns, these columns are still widely used in standard Oracle tables for backward compatibility reasons. But there are also business use cases where it makes sense to continue to use <code>RAW</code> columns rather than other data types.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.7 introduces a new custom converter specifically for Oracle called <code>RawToStringConverter</code> (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7753">DBZ-7753</a>). This custom converter is designed to allow you to quickly convert the byte-array contents of the <code>RAW</code> column to a string-based field using a <code>STRING</code> schema type. This can be useful for situations where you use a <code>RAW</code> column to store character data that doesn&#8217;t require the collation overhead of <code>VARCHAR2</code>, but you still have the need for this field to be sent to consumers as string-based data.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To get started with this custom converter, please see the <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.7/connectors/oracle.html#_raw_to_string">documentation</a> for more details.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="improved_nls_character_set_support_for_oracle">Improved NLS character-set support for Oracle</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When installing the Debezium 2.7 Oracle connector, you may notice a new dependency, <code>orai18n.jar</code>. This dependency is being automatically distributed to provide extended character-set support for certain dialects (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7761">DBZ-7761</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="improved_temporal_support_in_vitess">Improved temporal support in Vitess</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium relational connectors rely on a configuration option, <code>time.precision.mode</code>, to control how temporal values are added to change events. In some cases, you may want to use modes that align with Kafka types, using the <code>connect</code> mode. In other cases, you may prefer to avoid precision loss by using the default, <code>adaptive_milliseconds</code> mode.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium for Vitess connector has traditionally not followed this model, and instead has emitted temporal values as string-based types. While this helps avoid the loss of precision problem when using the <code>connect</code> mode, this adds unnecessary overhead on consumers to parse and manipulate these values.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In Debezium 2.7, Vitess aligns this behavior with other relational connectors, using the <code>time.precision.mode</code> to control how temporal values are sent (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7773">DBZ-7773</a>). By default, it will use the <code>adaptive_milliseconds</code> mode, but you can customize this to use <code>connect</code> mode if you prefer. The emission of string-based temporal values has been removed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="other-changes">Other changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Altogether, <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%202.7.0.Alpha1%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC">50 issues</a> were fixed in this release.

This is a reasonable default because Debezium does not know the application&#8217;s purpose for using a <code>RAW</code> column, and it is packaging the data from the column as-is. However, this may not be ideal for consumer applications that would prefer the data emitted as a <code>STRING</code> type rather than as <code>BYTES</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To help users, we&#8217;ve introduced a new <code>RawToStringConverter</code>, which automatically emits <code>RAW</code> columns as <code>STRING</code> based types rather than the default of <code>BYTES</code> (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7753">DBZ-7753</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To configure the converter, simply add the following configuration:</p> </div> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="properties">converters=raw-to-string

The upgrade to Debezium 2.6 includes a total of 7 unique breaking changes:</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">MySQL</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The MysQL driver was updated to version 8.3.0, and this driver is not compatible with MySQL 5.x. If you still need to use an older MySQL version, please downgrade the driver after installation to a version that is compatible with your database (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7652">DBZ-7652</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">MongoDB</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The MongoDB connector no longer supports the <code>replica_set</code> mode (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7260)">DBZ-7260</a>). This has been a feature that has been deprecated for several versions and there has been ongoing work over Debezium 2.x to achieve this goal. If you are using the <code>replica_set</code> mode, you will need to make adjustments when using Debezium 2.6+.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">SQL Server</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The SQL Server connector was not capturing all schemas when the connector was first deployed, and instead, was only capturing the schemas based on the tables defined in the configuration&#8217;s include list. This was a bug that could prevent users from easily adding new tables to the connector when expecting that the new table&#8217;s schema would already exist in the schema history topic. The connector now correctly honors the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> configuration option (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7593">DBZ-7593</a>).<br> <br> For existing connector deployments, if you do not specifically set the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> property for the schema history topic, the connector will begin capturing schema changes for all relevant tables in your database. If you want to prevent this and retain the prior behavior, you will need to adjust your connector configuration by adding <code>schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> with a value of <code>true</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Oracle</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>In older versions of Debezium, users were required to manually install the <code>ojdbc8.jar</code> JDBC driver. With 2.6, the connector now bundles the Oracle JDBC driver with the connector, so manual installation is no longer necessary (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7364">DBZ-7364</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> </dl> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also updated the driver to version <code>21.11.0.0</code>, please verify that you do not have multiple versions after upgrading to Debezium 2.6 (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7365">DBZ-7365</a>).</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">Vitess</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The task configuration format used by previous versions of the connector could de-stabilize the Kafka Connect cluster. To resolve the problem, Debezium 2.6 introduces a new configuration format that is incompatible with the previous format (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7250">DBZ-7250</a>). When upgrading, you may experience a <code>NullPointerException</code> and the error indicating that the connector was unable to instantiate a task because it contains an invalid task configuration.<br> <br> If you experience this problem, delete and re-create the connector, using the same name and configuration as before. The connector(s) will start and re-use the offsets last stored by using the same name, but will not re-use the old task configurations, avoiding the start-up failure. <br></p> </li> <li> <p>The Vitess connector previously used the timestamp of <code>BEGIN</code> message as the source timestamp. This has been changed to the usage of the <code>COMMIT</code> timestamp to reflect the behaviour of other connectors (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7628">DBZ-7628</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Container Images</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The handling of the <code>MAVEN_DEP_DESTINATION</code> environment variable has changed in the <code>connect-base</code> container image, which is the basis for <code>debezium/connect</code>. It is no longer used for downloading all dependencies, including connectors, but only for general purpose Maven Central located dependencies (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7551">DBZ-7551</a>).

In preparation for Debezium 3 later this year, we are making the shift to a compile-time baseline for Debezium 2.6 and 2.7 to require Java 17 (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7387">DBZ-7387</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are a Debezium user, and you consume Debezium connectors, this will require no action on your part.

If you have been using Java 17, there should be no action taken on your part.

The most common is to deploy Debezium on Kafka Connect while the second most common is to use Debezium Server, a read-made runtime for Debezium connectors. However, there is a third option called the Embedded Engine, and it is what Debezium uses internally for its test suite, it&#8217;s the foundation for Debezium Server, and it&#8217;s meant to provide a way to embed Debezium connectors inside your own application. The embedded engine is used by a variety of external contributors and frameworks, most notably Apache Flink heavily relies on the embedded engine for their Debezium based CDC connectors.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One of the biggest and major new features of Debezium 2.6 is the work on the asynchronous embedded engine that we are debuting in this alpha release. This new asynchronous version the foundation for which Debezium Server and the future of embedding Debezium is based. This change focuses on several key goals and initiatives:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Run multiple source tasks for a given connector, if the connector supports multiple tasks</p> </li> <li> <p>Run time-consuming code (transformations or serialization) in dedicated threads</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow additional performance by disabling event dispatch order</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide future technology benefits of things such as virtual threads and delegating to external workers</p> </li> <li> <p>Better integration with Debezium Operator for Kubernetes and Debezium UI</p> </li> <li> <p>Seamlessly integrate with Quarkus for Debezium Server</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>What this new asynchronous model does not include or focus on are the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Implement parallelization inside a connector&#8217;s main capture loop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove any dependency from Kafka Connect</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for multiple source connectors per Engine deployment</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for sink connectors</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Even if a connector is single-threaded and does not support multiple tasks, a connector deployment using the Embedded Engine or Debezium Server can take advantage of the new asynchronous model. A large portion of time during even dispatch is spent on transformation and serialization phases, so utilizing the new dedicated worker threads for such stages improves throughput.</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For developers who want to get started with the new asynchronous embedded engine, a new package is now included in the <code>debezium-embedded</code> artifact called <code>io.debezium.embedded.async</code> and this package contains all the pertinent components to utilizing this new implementation.

We will be updating the documentation in coming releases to highlight all the benefits and changes, including examples. Until then, you can find all the details in the design document, <a href="https://github.com/vjuranek/debezium-design-documents/blob/DBZ-7073/DDD-7.md">DDD-7</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="new_unified_snapshot_modes">New Unified Snapshot Modes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The snapshot process is an integral part of each connector&#8217;s lifecycle, and it&#8217;s responsible for collecting and sending all the historical data that exists in your data store to your target systems, if desired. For Debezium users who work with multiple connector types, we understand that having differing snapshot modes across connectors can sometimes be confusing to work with. So this change is designed to address that.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For many of you who may have already tried or installed Debezium 2.6 pre-releases, you&#8217;re already using the unified snapshot SPI as it was designed to be a drop-in-replacement initially, requiring no changes. This release finishes that work for MongoDB and DB2.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Of these changes, the most notable include the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>All snapshot modes are available to all connectors, excluding <code>never</code> which remains specific to MySQL. This means that connectors that may have previously not supported a snapshot mode, such as <code>when_needed</code>, can now use this mode to retake a snapshot when the connector identifies that its necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>schema_only_recovery</code> mode has been deprecated and replaced by <code>recovery</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>schema_only</code> mode has also been deprecated and replaced by <code>no_data</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="admonitionblock important"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All deprecated modes will remain available until Debezium 3 later this year.

One of the unique benefits with doing this is we can identify where there is code overlap between a connector&#8217;s runtime and the UI, and develop interface contracts to expose this shared data.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks to a community contribution for <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7167">DBZ-7167</a>, the <code>RelationalBaseSourceConnector</code> contract has been adjusted and a new method introduced to return a list of table names that match the connector&#8217;s specific configuration.

This release includes a number of improvements, including XML support for the Oracle OpenLogReplicator adapter, TRACE level logging support for Debezium Server, configurable partition modes for Cassandra, the new Snapshot API for MongoDB and Db2, and more.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Additionally, this release includes a variety of bug fixes and several breaking changes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at all these changes and improvements included in Debezium 2.6.0.CR1; as always, you can find the complete list of changes for this release in the <a href="/releases/2.6/release-notes">release notes</a>. Please remember to take special note to any breaking changes that could affect your upgrade path.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p></p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="breaking_changes">Breaking changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While we strive to avoid breaking changes, sometimes those changes are inevitable to evolve the right direction. This release includes several breaking changes.</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">MySQL</dt> <dd> <p>The MysQL driver was updated to version 8.3.0, and this driver is not compatible with MySQL 5.x. If you still need to use an older MySQL version, please downgrade the driver after installation to a version that is compatible with your database (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7652">DBZ-7652</a>).</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">SQL Server</dt> <dd> <p>The SQL Server connector was not capturing all schemas when the connector was first deployed, and instead, was only capturing the schemas based on the tables defined in the configuration&#8217;s include list. This was a bug that could prevent users from easily adding new tables to the connector when expecting that the new table&#8217;s schema would already exist in the schema history topic. The connector now correctly honors the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> configuration option (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7593">DBZ-7593</a>).<br> <br> For existing connector deployments, if you do not specifically set the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> property for the schema history topic, the connector will begin capturing schema changes for all relevant tables in your database. If you want to prevent this and retain the prior behavior, you will need to adjust your connector configuration by adding <code>schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> with a value of <code>true</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Vitess</dt> <dd> <p>The Vitess connector previously used the timestamp of <code>BEGIN</code> message as the source timestamp. This has been changed to the usage of the <code>COMMIT</code> timestamp to reflect the behaviour of other connectors (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7628">DBZ-7628</a>).</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="new_features_and_improvements">New features and improvements</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.6.CR1 also introduces more improvements and features, lets take a look at each individually.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="xml_support_for_openlogreplicator">XML Support for OpenLogReplicator</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium for Oracle connector supports connections with OpenLogReplicator, allowing Oracle users to stream changes directly from the transaction logs. The latest build of OpenLogReplicator, version <strong>1.5.0</strong> has added support for XML column types.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To get started streaming XML with OpenLogReplicator, please upgrade the OpenLogReplicator process to 1.5.0 and restart the replicator process. Be aware that if you want to stream binary-based XML column data, you will need to toggle this feature as enabled in the OpenLogReplicator configuration.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="trace_level_logging_for_debezium_server">TRACE level logging for Debezium Server</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium Server is a ready-made runtime for Debezium source connectors that uses the Quarkus framework to manage the source and sink deployments. As most Debezium Server users are aware who have reached out with questions or bugs, we often ask for TRACE-level logs and this has often proven difficult as it requires a full rebuild of Debezium Server due to how minimum logging level is a build-time configuration in Quarkus.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Debezium 2.6.0.CR1 release and later, this will no longer be required. The build time configuration has been adjusted by default to include TRACE logging levels, so moving forward users can simply set the log level to TRACE and restart Debezium Server to obtain the logs (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/brwose/DBZ-7369">DBZ-7369</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="new_unified_snapshot_modes">New Unified Snapshot Modes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The snapshot process is an integral part of each connector&#8217;s lifecycle, and it&#8217;s responsible for collecting and sending all the historical data that exists in your data store to your target systems, if desired. For Debezium users who work with multiple connector types, we understand that having differing snapshot modes across connectors can sometimes be confusing to work with. So this change is designed to address that.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For many of you who may have already tried or installed Debezium 2.6 pre-releases, you&#8217;re already using the unified snapshot SPI as it was designed to be a drop-in-replacement initially, requiring no changes. This release finishes that work for MongoDB and DB2.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Of these changes, the most notable include the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>All snapshot modes are available to all connectors, excluding <code>never</code> which remains specific to MySQL. This means that connectors that may have previously not supported a snapshot mode, such as <code>when_needed</code>, can now use this mode to retake a snapshot when the connector identifies that its necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>schema_only_recovery</code> mode has been deprecated and replaced by <code>recovery</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>schema_only</code> mode has also been deprecated and replaced by <code>no_data</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="admonitionblock important"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All deprecated modes will remain available until Debezium 3 later this year. This provides users with about six months to adjust scripts, configurations, and processes in advance.</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="cassandra_configurable_partition_modes">Cassandra configurable partition modes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When a Debezium Cassandra connector read the commit logs, events are processed sequentially and added to a queue. If multiple queues exist, events become distributed between these queues based on the hash of the commit log filename. This resulted in situations where events could be emitted in non-chronological order.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Debezium 2.6, the Cassandra connector&#8217;s hashing algorithm now uses the partition column names to resolve the queue index for insertion. This should provide a more stable insert order so that events are emitted in the correct order.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A new configuration option has been added to opt-in to this new behavior. Debezium users can add the new configuration property <code>event.order.guarantee.mode</code> set to <code>partition_values</code> to take advantage of this new mode. By default, the property retains the old behavior using a default of <code>commitlog_file</code>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="other_fixes">Other fixes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In addition, there were quite a number of stability and bug fixes that made it into this release. These include the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Log Mining Processor advances SCN incorrectly if LogMiner query returns no rows <a

This was a bug that could prevent users from easily adding new tables to the connector when expecting that the new table&#8217;s schema would already exist in the schema history topic. The connector now correctly honors the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> configuration option (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7593">DBZ-7593</a>).<br> <br> For existing connector deployments, if you do not specifically set the <code>store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> property for the schema history topic, the connector will begin capturing schema changes for all relevant tables in your database. If you want to prevent this and retain the prior behavior, you will need to adjust your connector configuration by adding <code>schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.tables.ddl</code> with a value of <code>true</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="improvements_and_changes">Improvements and changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="trace_level_logging_for_debezium_server">TRACE level logging for Debezium Server</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium Server is a ready-made runtime for Debezium source connectors that uses the Quarkus framework to manage the source and sink deployments. As most Debezium Server users are aware who have reached out with questions or bugs, we often ask for TRACE-level logs and this has often proven difficult as it requires a full rebuild of Debezium Server due to how minimum logging level is a build-time configuration in Quarkus.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Debezium 2.5.3.Final and the upcoming Debezium 2.6.0.Final releases, this will no longer be required. The build time configuration has been adjusted by default to include TRACE logging levels, so moving forward users can simply set the log level to TRACE and restart Debezium Server to obtain the logs (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/brwose/DBZ-7369">DBZ-7369</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="informix_appends_lsn_to_transaction_identifier">Informix appends LSN to Transaction Identifier</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Informix databases only increases the transaction identifier when there are concurrent transactions, otherwise the value remains identical for sequential transactions.

Thanks to a community contribution as part of <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7512">DBZ-7512</a>, Debezium can be configured to use two new formats called <code>simplestring</code> and <code>binary</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <code>simplestring</code> and <code>binary</code> formats are configured in Debezium server using the <code>debezium.format</code> configurations. For <code>simplestring</code>, the payload will be serialized as a single <code>STRING</code> data type into the topic. For <code>binary</code>, the payload will be serialized as a <code>BYTES</code> using a <code>byte[]</code> (byte array).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="oracle_logminer_hybrid_mining_strategy">Oracle LogMiner Hybrid Mining Strategy</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.6 also introduces a new Oracle LogMiner mining strategy called <em>hyrid</em>, which can be enabled by setting the configuration property <code>log.mining.strategy</code> with the value of <code>hybrid</code>. This new strategy is designed to support all schema evolution features of the default mining strategy while taking advantage of all the performance optimizations from the online catalog strategy.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The main problem with the <code>online_catalog</code> strategy is that if a mining step observes a schema change and a data change in the same mining step, LogMiner is incapable of reconstructing the SQL correctly, which will result in the table name being <code>OBJ# xxxxxx</code> or the columns represented as <code>COL1</code>, <code>COL2</code>, and so on. To avoid this while using the online catalog strategy, users are recommended to perform schema changes in a lock-step pattern to avoid a mining step that observes both a schema change and a data change together; however, this is not always feasible.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The new hybrid strategy works by tracking a table&#8217;s object id at the database level and then using this identifier to look up the schema associated with the table from Debezium&#8217;s relational table model. In short, this allows Debezium to do what Oracle LogMiner is unable to do in these specific corner cases. The table name will be taken from the relational model&#8217;s table name and columns will be mapped by column position.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Unfortunately, Oracle does not provide a way to reconstruct failed SQL operations for CLOB, BLOB, and XML data types. This means that the new hybrid strategy cannot be configured with configurations that use <code>lob.enabled</code> set to <code>true</code>. If a connector is started using the hybrid strategy and has <code>lob.enabled</code> set to <code>true</code>, the connector will fail to start and report a configuration failure.</p> </div> </div>

We enter the home stretch with this release, packed with many improvements, enhancements, bug fixes, and yes a brand new Db2 connector for iSeries. There is a lot to cover in this release, so lets dive right in! Breaking changes The team aims to avoid any potential breaking changes between minor releases; however, such changes are sometimes inevitable. Oracle In older versions of Debezium, users were required to manually install the ojdbc8.jar JDBC driver. With 2.6, the connector now bundles the Oracle JDBC driver with the connector, so manual installation is no longer necessary (DBZ-7364). We&#8217;ve also updated the driver to version 21.11.0.0, please verify that you do not have multiple versions after upgrading to Debezium 2.6 (DBZ-7365). Container Images The handling of the MAVEN_DEP_DESTINATION environment variable has changed in the connect-base container image, which is the basis for debezium/connect. It is no longer used for downloading all dependencies, including connectors, but only for general purpose Maven Central located dependencies (DBZ-7551). If you were using custom images that relied on this environment variable, your image build steps may require modifications. Improvements and changes Db2 for iSeries connector Debezium 2.6 introduces a brand-new connector for IBM fans to stream changes from Db2 iSeries/AS400 using the IBM iJournal system. This collaboration is a multi-year development effort from the community, and we&#8217;re pleased that the community has allowed this to be distributed under the Debezium umbrella. The new connector can be obtained from Maven Central using the following coordinates or a direct download. &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;io.debezium&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;debezium-connector-ibmi&lt;/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;2.6.0.Beta1&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; The documentation for this new connector is still a work-in-progress. If you have any questions, please be sure to reach out to the team on Zulip or the mailing list. Incremental snapshot row-value constructors for PostgreSQL The PostgreSQL driver supports a SQL syntax called a row-value constructor using the ROW() function. This allows a query to express predicate conditions in a more efficient way when working with multi-columned primary keys that have a suitable index. The incremental snapshot process is an ideal candidate for the use of the ROW() function, the process involves issuing a series of select SQL statements to fetch data in chunks. Each statement, aka chunk query, should ideally be as efficient as possible to minimize the cost overhead of these queries to maximize throughput of your WAL changes to your topics. There are no specific changes needed, but the query issued for PostgreSQL incremental snapshots has been adjusted to take advantage of this new syntax, and therefore users who utilize incremental snapshots should see performance improvements. An example of the old query used might look like this for a simple table: SELECT * FROM users WHERE (a = 10 AND (b &gt; 2 OR b IS NULL)) OR (a &gt; 10) OR (a IS NULL) ORDER BY a, b LIMIT 1024 The new implementation constructs this query using the ROW() function as follows: SELECT * FROM users WHERE row(a,b) &gt; row(10,2) ORDER BY a, b LIMIT 1024 We&#8217;d be interested in any feedback on this change, and what performance improvements are observed. Signal table watermark metadata An incremental snapshot process requires a signal table to write open/close markers to coordinate the change boundaries with the data recorded in the transaction logs, unless you&#8217;re using MySQL&#8217;s read-only flavor. In some cases, users would like to be able to track the window time slot, knowing when the window was opened and closed. Starting with Debezium 2.6, the data column in the signal table will be populated with the time window details, allowing users to obtain when the window was opened and closed. The following shows the details of the data column for each of the two signal markers: Window Open Marker {&quot;openWindowTimestamp&quot;: &quot;&lt;window-open-time&gt;&quot;} Window Close Marker {&quot;openWindowTimestamp&quot;: &quot;&lt;window-open-time&gt;&quot;, &quot;closeWindowTimestamp&quot;: &quot;&lt;window-close-time&gt;&quot;} Oracle Redo SQL per event with LogMiner We have improved the Oracle connector&#8217;s event structure for inserts, updates, and deletes to optionally contain the SQL that was reconstructed by LogMiner in the source information block. This feature is an opt-in only feature that you must enable as this can easily more than double the size of your existing event payload. To enable the inclusion of the REDO SQL as part of the change event, add the following connector configuration: &quot;log.mining.include.redo.sql&quot;: &quot;true&quot; With this option enabled, the source information block contains a new field redo_sql, as shown below: &quot;source&quot;: { ... &quot;redo_sql&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO \&quot;DEBEZIUM\&quot;.\&quot;TEST\&quot; (\&quot;ID\&quot;,\&quot;DATA\&quot;) values ('1', 'Test');&quot; } This feature cannot be used with lob.enabled set to true due to how LogMiner reconstructs the SQL related to CLOB, BLOB, and XML data types. If the above configuration is added with lob.enabled set to true, the connector will start with an error about this misconfiguration. Oracle LogMiner transaction buffer improvements A new delay-strategy for transaction registration has been added when using LogMiner. This strategy effectively delays the creation of the transaction record in the buffer until we observe the first captured change for that transaction. For users who use the Infinispan cache or who have enabled lob.enabled, this delayed strategy cannot be used due to how specific operations are handled in these two modes of the connector. Delaying transaction registration has a number of benefits, which include: Reducing the overhead on the transaction cache, especially in a highly concurrent transaction scenario. Avoids long-running transactions that have no changes that are being captured by the connector. Should aid in advancing the low-watermark SCN in the offsets more efficiently in specific scenarios. We are looking into how we can explore this change for Infinispan-based users in a future build; however, due to the nature of how lob.enabled works with LogMiner, this feature won&#8217;t be possible for that use case. Improved event timestamp precision Debezium 2.6 introduces a new community requested feature to improve the precision of timestamps in change events. Users will now notice the addition of 4 new fields, two at the envelope level and two in the source information block as shown below: { &quot;source&quot;: { ..., &quot;ts_us&quot;: &quot;1559033904863123&quot;, &quot;ts_ns&quot;: &quot;1559033904863123000&quot; }, &quot;ts_us&quot;: &quot;1580390884335451&quot;, &quot;ts_ns&quot;: &quot;1580390884335451325&quot;, } The envelope values will always provide both microsecond (ts_us) and nanosecond (ts_ns) values while the source information block may have both micro and nano -second precision values truncated to a lower precision if the source database does not provide that level of precision. Informix appends LSN to Transaction Identifier Informix databases only increases the transaction identifier when there are concurrent transactions, otherwise the value remains identical for sequential transactions. This can prove difficult for users who may want to utilize the transaction metadata to order change events in a post processing step. Debezium 2.6 for Informix will now append the log sequence number (LSN) to the transaction identifier so that users can easily sort change events based on the transaction metadata. The transaction identifier field will now use the format &lt;id&gt;:&lt;lsn&gt;. This change affects transaction metadata events and the source information block for change events, as shown below: Transaction Begin Event { &quot;status&quot;: &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;571:53195829&quot;, ... } Transaction End Event { &quot;status&quot;: &quot;END&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;571:53195832&quot;, ... } Change Events { ... &quot;source&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;571:53195832&quot; ... } } New Arbitrary-based payload formats While it&#8217;s common for users to utilize serialization based on Json, Avro, Protobufs, or CloudEvents, there may be reasons to use a more simplistic format. Thanks to a community contribution as part of DBZ-7512, Debezium can be configured to use two new formats called simplestring and binary. The simplestring and binary formats are configured in Debezium server using the debezium.format configurations. For simplestring, the payload will be serialized as a single STRING data type into the topic. For binary, the payload will be serialized as a BYTES using a byte[] (byte array). Oracle LogMiner Hybrid Mining Strategy Debezium 2.6 also introduces a new Oracle LogMiner mining strategy called hyrid, which can be enabled by setting the configuration property log.mining.strategy with the value of hybrid. This new strategy is designed to support all schema evolution features of the default mining strategy while taking advantage of all the performance optimizations from the online catalog strategy. The main problem with the online_catalog strategy is that if a mining step observes a schema change and a data change in the same mining step, LogMiner is incapable of reconstructing the SQL correctly, which will result in the table name being OBJ# xxxxxx or the columns represented as COL1, COL2, and so on. To avoid this while using the online catalog strategy, users are recommended to perform schema changes in a lock-step pattern to avoid a mining step that observes both a schema change and a data change together; however, this is not always feasible. The new hybrid strategy works by tracking a table&#8217;s object id at the database level and then using this identifier to look up the schema associated with the table from Debezium&#8217;s relational table model. In short, this allows Debezium to do what Oracle LogMiner is unable to do in these specific corner cases. The table name will be taken from the relational model&#8217;s table name and columns will be mapped by column position. Unfortunately, Oracle does not provide a way to reconstruct failed SQL operations for CLOB, BLOB, and XML data types. This means that the new hybrid strategy cannot be configured with configurations that use lob.enabled set to true. If a connector is started using the hybrid strategy and has lob.enabled set to true, the connector will fail to start and report a configuration failure.

This release is filled to the brim with new features, improvements, and bug fixes, so let&#8217;s dive into these&#8230;&#8203;</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p></p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="breaking_changes">Breaking changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The team aims to avoid any potential breaking changes between minor releases; however, such changes are sometimes inevitable.</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">Vitess</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The task configuration format used by previous versions of the connector could de-stabilize the Kafka Connect cluster. To resolve the problem, Debezium 2.6 introduces a new configuration format that is incompatible with the previous format (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7250">DBZ-7250</a>). When upgrading, you may experience a <code>NullPointerException</code> and the error indicating that the connector was unable to instantiate a task because it contains an invalid task configuration.<br> <br> If you experience this problem, delete and re-create the connector, using the same name and configuration as before. The connector(s) will start and re-use the offsets last stored by using the same name, but will not re-use the old task configurations, avoiding the start-up failure.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="improvements_and_changes">Improvements and changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="java_17_now_compile_time_requirement">Java 17 now compile-time requirement</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 3.0 which will debut later this fall will once again shift the Java baseline requirement from Java 11 to 17 to use Debezium. In preparation for Debezium 3 later this year, we are making the shift to a compile-time baseline for Debezium 2.6 and 2.7 to require Java 17 (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7387">DBZ-7387</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are a Debezium user, and you consume Debezium connectors, this will require no action on your part. You can continue to use Java 11 for now without issue, understanding that Debezium 3 will require Java 17 later this year.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are developing Debezium connectors, Java 17 is now baseline to compile the Debezium source. If you have been using Java 17, there should be no action taken on your part. If you previously were using Java 11, you will need to move to Java 17 in order to compile from source.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are using the Debezium Quarkus Outbox Extension (not the Outbox SMT), as Quarkus 3.7+ is making the move to Java 17 as their baseline, the Debezium Quarkus Outbox Extension will now require Java 17 as a baseline for both runtime and compile time.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We expect this transition to be mostly seamless for most users as this should have absolutely no impact on the runtime of Debezium&#8217;s connectors nor Debezium Server at this time.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="asynchronous_embedded_engine">Asynchronous Embedded Engine</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;re hearing about the Embedded Engine for the first time, Debezium ships with three ways to run Debezium connectors. The most common is to deploy Debezium on Kafka Connect while the second most common is to use Debezium Server, a read-made runtime for Debezium connectors. However, there is a third option called the Embedded Engine, and it is what Debezium uses internally for its test suite, it&#8217;s the foundation for Debezium Server, and it&#8217;s meant to provide a way to embed Debezium connectors inside your own application. The embedded engine is used by a variety of external contributors and frameworks, most notably Apache Flink heavily relies on the embedded engine for their Debezium based CDC connectors.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One of the biggest and major new features of Debezium 2.6 is the work on the asynchronous embedded engine that we are debuting in this alpha release. This new asynchronous version the foundation for which Debezium Server and the future of embedding Debezium is based. This change focuses on several key goals and initiatives:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Run multiple source tasks for a given connector, if the connector supports multiple tasks</p> </li> <li> <p>Run time-consuming code (transformations or serialization) in dedicated threads</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow additional performance by disabling event dispatch order</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide future technology benefits of things such as virtual threads and delegating to external workers</p> </li> <li> <p>Better integration with Debezium Operator for Kubernetes and Debezium UI</p> </li> <li> <p>Seamlessly integrate with Quarkus for Debezium Server</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>What this new asynchronous model does not include or focus on are the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Implement parallelization inside a connector&#8217;s main capture loop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove any dependency from Kafka Connect</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for multiple source connectors per Engine deployment</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for sink connectors</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Even if a connector is single-threaded and does not support multiple tasks, a connector deployment using the Embedded Engine or Debezium Server can take advantage of the new asynchronous model. A large portion of time during even dispatch is spent on transformation and serialization phases, so utilizing the new dedicated worker threads for such stages improves throughput.</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For developers who want to get started with the new asynchronous embedded engine, a new package is now included in the <code>debezium-embedded</code> artifact called <code>io.debezium.embedded.async</code> and this package contains all the pertinent components to utilizing this new implementation. The asynchronous model can be constructed in a similar way to the serial version using the builder pattern, shown below.</p> </div> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java"><span class="directive">final</span> DebeziumEngine engine = <span class="keyword">new</span> AsyncEngine.AsyncEngineBuilder()

    .build();</code></pre> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We encourage everyone to take a look at the new Asynchronous Embedded Engine model, let us know your thoughts and if you spot any bugs or problems. We will be updating the documentation in coming releases to highlight all the benefits and changes, including examples. Until then, you can find all the details in the design document, <a href="https://github.com/vjuranek/debezium-design-documents/blob/DBZ-7073/DDD-7.md">DDD-7</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="timestamp_converter_improvements">Timestamp converter improvements</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium released the new <code>TimezoneConverter</code> in Debezium 2.4, allowing users to target a specific time zone and to convert the outgoing payload time values to that targeted time zone. The original implementation was specifically restricted to allow conversion of values within the <code>before</code> or <code>after</code> parts of the payload; however, thanks to an improvement as a part of <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7022">DBZ-7022</a>, the converter can now be used to convert other time-based fields in the metadata, such as <code>ts_ms</code> in the <code>source</code> information block.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This change helps to improve lag metric calculations in situations where the JVM running the connector is using a time zone that differs from the database and the calculation of the <em>envelope ts_ms</em> - <em>source ts_ms</em> results in a variance caused by the time zone. By using the <code>TimezoneConverter</code> to convert metadata fields, you can easily calculate the lag between those two fields without the time zone interfering.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="sql_server_query_improvements">SQL Server query improvements</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium SQL Server utilizes a common SQL Server stored procedure called <code>fn_cdc_get_all_changes&#8230;&#8203;</code> to fetch all the relevant captured changes for a given table. This query performs several unions and only ever returns data from one of the union sub-queries, which can be inefficient.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.6 for SQL Server introduces a new configuration property <code>data.query.mode</code> that can be used to influence which specific method the connector will use to gather the details about table changes (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7273">DBZ-7273</a>). The default remains unchanged from older releases, using the value <code>function</code> to delegate to the above aforementioned stored procedure. A new option, called <code>direct</code>, can be used instead to build the query directly within the connector to gather the changes more efficiently.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="scoped_keytrust_store_support_with_mongodb">Scoped Key/Trust - store support with MongoDB</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium supports secure connections; however, MongoDB requires that the key/trust -store configurations be supplied as JVM process arguments, which is less than ideal for environments like the cloud. As a first step toward aligning how secure connection configuration is specified across our connectors, Debezium 2.6 for MongoDB now supports specifying scoped key/trust -store configurations in the connector configuration (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7379">DBZ-7379</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MongoDB connector now includes the following new configuration properties:</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.keystore</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the path to the SSL keystore file.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.keystore.password</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the credentials to open and access the SSL keystore provided by <em>mongodb.ssl.keystore</em>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.keystore.type</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the SSL keystore file type, defaults to <code>PKC512</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.truststore</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the path to the SSL truststore file.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.truststore.password</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the credentials to open and access the SSL truststore provided by <em>mongodb.ssl.truststore</em>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>mongodb.ssl.truststore.type</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the SSL truststore file type, defaults to <code>PKC512</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="source_transaction_id_changes">Source transaction id changes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All Debezium change events contain a special metadata block called the <code>source</code> information block. This part of the event payload is responsible for providing metadata about the change event, including the unique identifier of the change, the time the change happened, the database and table the change is in reference to, as well as transaction metadata about the transaction that the change participated in.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In Debezium 2.6, the <code>transaction_id</code> field in the source information block will no longer be provided unless the field is populated with a value. This should present no issue for users as this field was only populated when the connector was configured with <code>provide.transaction.metadata</code> set to <code>true</code> (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7380">DBZ-7380</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you have tooling that expects the existence of the source information block&#8217;s <code>transaction_id</code> field although its optional, you will need to adjust that behavior as the field will no longer be present unless populated.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="google_pubsub_ordering_key_support">Google PubSub Ordering Key Support</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium Server Google PubSub sink adapter has received a small update in Debezium 2.6. If you are streaming changes that have foreign key relationships, you may have wondered whether it was possible to specify an ordering key so that foreign key constraints could be maintained.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.6 introduces a new configurable property for the Google PubSub sink adapter, <code>ordering.key</code>, which allows the sink adapter to use an externally provided ordering key from the connector configuration for the events rather than using the default behavior based on the event&#8217;s key (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7435">DBZ-7435</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="mongodb_uuid_key_support_for_incremental_snapshots">MongoDB UUID key support for Incremental snapshots</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As a small improvement to the Incremental Snapshot process for the Debezium for MongoDB connector, Debezium 2.6 adds support for the UUID data type, allowing this data type to be used within the Incremental Snapshot process like other data types (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7451">DBZ-7451</a>).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="mongodb_post_image_changes">MongoDB post-image changes</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MongoDB connector&#8217;s event payload can be configured to include the full document that was changed in an update. The connector previously made an opinionated choice about how the full document would be fetched as part of the change stream; however, this behavior was not consistent with our expectations in all use cases.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.6 introduces a new configuration option, <code>capture.mode.full.update.type</code>, allowing the connector to explicitly control how the change stream&#8217;s full document lookup should be handled (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7299">DBZ-7299</a>). The default value for this option is <code>lookup</code>, meaning that the database will make a separate look-up to fetch the full document. If you are working with MongoDB 6+, you can also elect to use <code>post_image</code> to rely on MongoDB change stream&#8217;s post-image support.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1">

One of the unique benefits with doing this is we can identify where there is code overlap between a connector&#8217;s runtime and the UI, and develop interface contracts to expose this shared data.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks to a community contribution for <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7167">DBZ-7167</a>, the <code>RelationalBaseSourceConnector</code> contract has been adjusted and a new method introduced to return a list of table names that match the connector&#8217;s specific configuration.

So when pairing CloudEvents formatted messages with schema registry, the same applies and in Debezium 2.6, you can explicitly control how the name is registered.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>By default, the schema for a CloudEvent message will be automatically generated by the converter. However, if the auto generated schema names are not sufficient, you can adjust the configuration by specifying <code>dataSchemaName</code>, which can be set either to <code>generate</code> (the default behavior) or <code>header</code> to pull the schema name directly from the specified event header field.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="oracle_infinispan_cache_improvements">Oracle Infinispan cache improvements</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium Oracle connector maintains a buffer of all in-flight transactions, and this buffer can be allocated off-heap using Infinispan. Sometimes, the user configuration specifies that if an in-flight transaction lasts longer than the specified number of milliseconds, the transaction can be abandoned or discarded by the buffer. This means that the transaction will be forgotten and not emitted by the connector.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In order to improve metrics integration with frameworks like Grafana and Prometheus, a new JMX metric, <code>AbandonedTransactionCount</code>, was added to track the number of transactions that are abandoned by the connector during it&#8217;s runtime.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="supports_spanner_new_row_and_old_values_value_capture_type">Supports Spanner <code>NEW_ROW_AND_OLD_VALUES</code> value capture type</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Google Spanner&#8217;s value capture type is responsible for controlling how the change stream represents the change data in the event stream and are configured when constructing the change stream.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Spanner introduced a new value capture mode called <code>NEW_ROW_AND_OLD_VALUES</code>, which is responsible for capturing all values of tracked columns, both modified and unmodified, whenever any column changes.

Get ready to unwrap this latest minor version, filled with holiday cheer and exciting new features!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Let&#8217;s take a moment and review all the new features, changes, and improvements that are included in Debezium 2.5, which includes <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20and%20fixVersion%20%20in%20(2.5.0.Alpha1%2C%202.5.0.Alpha2%2C%202.5.0.Beta1%2C%202.5.0.Beta2%2C%202.5.0.CR1%2C%202.5.0.Final)">181 issues</a> resolved by 37 unique contributors.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p></p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="breaking_changes">Breaking changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While we try to avoid any potential breaking changes between minor releases, such changes are sometimes inevitable. The upgrade to Debezium 2.5 includes a total of 10 unique breaking changes:</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">MySQL</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The MySQL community announced that MySQL 5.7 would enter its End of Life cycle at the end of October 2023 In accordance with this upstream community news, Debezium too is making adjustments, like other vendors, around this recent news. To that end, starting with Debezium 2.5, we will no longer be testing nor supporting MySQL 5.7 if full capacity, thus MySQL 5.7 enters what we call "best-effort" support. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6874">DBZ-6874</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>MySQL <code>BIT</code> datatype did not have an implicit length if any was not set. This is incorrect as the default length if none is provided is <code>1</code> (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7230">DBZ-7230</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">MongoDB</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>In earlier versions of Debezium, a user could use the MongoDB connector and perform a snapshot of a collection on a specific shard when using a MongoDB sharded deployment. Unfortunately, while we understand that users may have taken advantage of this behavior, it was unintended and not supported. Debezium 2.5 removes this ability entirely, and it&#8217;s a step in the forward goal to deprecate and remove the replica-set streaming mode in MongoDB completely (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7139">DBZ-7139</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Default connection mode is changed from <code>replica_set</code> to <code>sharded</code> as a preparation step for its complete removal. The change will lead to invalidation of existing offsets and a silent re-execution of the initial snapshot. To prevent this a check was added that will fail the connector upon start if this would happen. The user can either set <code>replica_set</code> connection mode explicitly or can remove the existing offsets (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7272">DBZ-7272</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">JDBC</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>There was a corner case reported where the JDBC sink connector was mistakenly writing fields that had <code>null</code> values to the target database with the default value instead of a value of <code>NULL</code>. This has been fixed in Debezium 2.5 (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7191">DBZ-7191</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Core</dt> <dd> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>If you are presently using the CloudEvents converter to emit events that conform to the CloudEvents format, it&#8217;s important to note that the configuration option <code>metadata.location</code> was renamed to <code>metadata.source</code>. You will need to be sure to update your connector configurations to reflect this change with Debezium 2.5 and onward. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7060">DBZ-7060</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Part of the team&#8217;s focus in Debezium 2.5 was to improve the Debezium Embedded Engine&#8217;s experience. With that goal in mind, we took this preview release as an opportunity to clean-up the embedded engine&#8217;s API.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your usage of the Debezium Embedded Engine utilized any of the previously deprecated APIs on <code>EmbeddedEngine</code>, you will find those methods have since been removed. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7110">DBZ-7100</a>) The recommended path forward is to make sure that you&#8217;re using the <code>DebeziumEngine</code> interface provided by the <code>debezium-api</code> artifact.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>ComputePartition</code> was an SMT that enabled users to compute the desired partition for which an event would be written in a Kafka topic. This single message transformation (SMT) was deprecated some time ago in favor of the new <code>PartitionRouting</code> single message transformation. Debezium 2.5 removes the old, deprecated <code>ComputePartition</code>, and users who may still be relying on this SMT will need to migrate to the new <code>PartitionRouting</code> SMT if you have not already done so (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7141">DBZ-7141</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>The schema name prefix and letter casing for Cloud Event headers was not consistent with payload name. The schema name was aligned so both headers and payload share th same namespace and follow the same rules for letter casing (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7216">DBZ-7216</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="improvements_and_changes">Improvements and changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In this section, we&#8217;re going to take a tour of all the new features and improvements in Debezium 2.5.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="core">Core</h3> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="redis_schema_history_retries_now_limited">Redis Schema History Retries now Limited</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5 introduces a new configuration option, <code>schema.history.internal.redis.max.attempts</code> designed to limit the number of retry attempts while connecting to a Redis database when it becomes unavailable, previously it simply retried forever.

Our next steps is to look into GTID support, which MariaDB supports but using an approach that isn&#8217;t compatible with MySQL.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Stay tuned for future builds as we continue to expand on this and we certainly welcome any early feedback.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="gtid_support">GTID support</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Both MySQL and MariaDB support what is called Global Transaction Identifiers or GTIDs. These are used in replication to uniquely identify transaction(s) uniquely across a cluster. The implementation details between MySQL and MariaDB differ significantly and in earlier versions of Debezium, we only supported GTID with MySQL.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Debezium 2.5, we are taking another step forward by introducing GTID support for MariaDB as part of the MySQL connector offering. In order to take advantage of this behavior, you will need to use the MariaDB driver rather than the MySQL driver by using a JDBC connection prefixed as <code>jdbc:mariadb</code> rather than <code>jdbc:mysql</code>. By doing this, you can now take full advantage of working with MariaDB and GTID just like MySQL (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1482">DBZ-1482</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

To achieve this, we revisited the connector to enable the processing of batches of events.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>You can now fine-tune the size of the batch using a new property: <code>batch.size</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <code>batch.size</code> property defines the number of records to be <strong>attempted</strong> for batching into the destination table. However, it&#8217;s crucial to note that the actual size of processed records is contingent upon the <code>consumer.max.poll.records</code> property of the Kafka Connect worker.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>It&#8217;s important to be aware that if you set <code>consumer.max.poll.records</code> in the Connect worker properties to a value lower than <code>batch.size</code>, batch processing will be constrained by <code>consumer.max.poll.records</code>, and the intended <code>batch.size</code> may not be achieved.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="configure_consumer_max_poll_records">Configure consumer max poll records</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you prefer not to configure the <code>consumer.max.poll.records</code> property globally on the Connect worker, you have the option to set the underlying consumer&#8217;s <code>max.poll.records</code> for a specific connector using <code>consumer.override.max.poll.records</code> in the connector configuration.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To enable per-connector configuration properties and override the default worker properties, add the following parameter to the worker properties file: <code>connector.client.config.override.policy</code> <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/references/allconfigs.html#override-the-worker-configuration">(see override-the-worker-configuration)</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This property defines which configurations can be overridden by the connector. The default implementation is <code>All</code>, but other possible policies include <code>None</code> and <code>Principal</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When <code>connector.client.config.override.policy=All</code>, each connector belonging to the worker is permitted to override the worker configuration. You can now utilize the following override prefixes for sink connector configurations: <code>consumer.override.&lt;sink-configuration-property&gt;</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>It&#8217;s worth noting that even if you set <code>max.poll.records</code> (with the default value of 500), you may receive fewer records. This is due to other properties that can impact record fetching from the topic/partitions.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>Name</strong>: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_fetch.max.bytes">fetch.max.bytes</a><br> <strong>Default</strong>: 52428800 (52MB)<br></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>Name</strong>: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_max.partition.fetch.bytes">max.partition.fetch.bytes</a><br> <strong>Default</strong>: 1048576 (1MB)<br></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>Name</strong>: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_message.max.bytes">message.max.bytes</a><br> <strong>Default</strong>: 1048588 (1MB)<br></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>Name</strong>: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs_max.message.bytes">max.message.bytes</a><br> <strong>Default</strong>: 1048588 (1MB)<br></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So adjust these based on your expected payload size to reach the desired number of poll records.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="results_from_performance_testing">Results from performance testing</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The objective of the performance tests was to provide a sense of how batch support improved the EPS.

The Debezium JDBC connector with batch support took approximately 7 minutes to insert all events, with an average throughput of 2300 eps, while the process without batch support took 570 minutes (9.5 hours). Therefore, the Debezium JDBC connector with batch support is 79 times faster than the version without batch support.</p> </div> <div class="imageblock centered-image"> <div class="content"> <img src="/assets/images/2023-12-06-JDBC-sink-connector-batch-support/1M-different-batch-size-json.png" alt="1M different batch size json"> </div> <div class="title">Figure 4. &#160;</div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In <em>Figure 4</em>, we observe the behavior of the Debezium JDBC connector using the <code>org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter</code> converter and writing to MySQL with different <code>batch.size</code> settings. While the initial differences are noticeable, it becomes apparent that the throughput continues to slow down. On average, all the <code>batch.size</code> configurations take about 7 minutes to process all events.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This raised a concern for us. After conducting a thorough analysis (profiling), we identified another issue: event deserialization. With high probability, this was the cause of the non-scalability of <code>batch.size</code> settings.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Although serialization improved scalability, we still lack an answer regarding the slowdown of EPS during the test run. One hypothesis could involve a certain type of buffer somewhere.</p> </div> <div class="imageblock centered-image"> <div class="content"> <img src="/assets/images/2023-12-06-JDBC-sink-connector-batch-support/1M-different-batch-size-avro.png" alt="1M different batch size avro"> </div> <div class="title">Figure 5. &#160;</div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We then conducted experiments with Avro, and as depicted in <em>Figure 5</em>, the results show a significant improvement. As expected, processing 1,000,000 events with <code>batch.size=500</code> is slower than with <code>batch.size=10000</code>. Notably, in our test configuration, the optimal value for <code>batch.size</code> is 1000, resulting in the fastest processing time.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Although the results are better compared to JSON, there is still some performance degradation.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To identify potential bottlenecks in the code, we added some metrics and found that the majority of time was spent executing batch statements on the database.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Further investigation revealed that our table had an index defined on the primary key, which was slowing down the inserts.</p> </div> <div class="imageblock centered-image"> <div class="content"> <img src="/assets/images/2023-12-06-JDBC-sink-connector-batch-support/1M-different-batch-size-avro-no-index.png" alt="1M different batch size avro no index"> </div> <div class="title">Figure 6. &#160;</div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>in <em>Figure 6</em> you can see the improved performance with Avro and without primary key index.

There are situations where this may be helpful, but it more often leads to a performance concerns for downstream processing.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5 adjusts this behavior in order to improve performance. By default, when neither a <code>partitionid</code> or <code>partitionkey</code> is defined, the EventHub sink will send events using a round-robin technique to all available partitions. Events can be forced into a single, fixed partition by specifying a <code>partitionid</code>. Alternatively, the <code>partitionkey</code> can be provided to supply a fixed partition key that will be used to route all events to a specific partition.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If additional partition routing requirements are necessary, you can now combine the <code>PartitionRouting</code> SMT accomplish such tasks.

This release includes a variety of breaking changes.</p> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="mongodb_default_connection_mode_changed">MongoDB default connection mode changed</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The upgrade to Debezium 2.5 brings a change to MongoDB&#8217;s default implementation. In previous builds, the default connection mode was <code>replica_set</code>; however with Debezium 2.5 this is now <code>sharded</code>. If you were connecting to a sharded cluster and not explicitly setting a connection mode; ergo, relying on the default behavior, you must review your connector configuration and make adjustments. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7108)">DBZ-7108</a>)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Overall, this change is part of larger effort to remove the <code>replica_set</code> mode entirely. Please be sure to review your connector configurations for all MongoDB connectors when upgrading.</p> </div> <div class="admonitionblock important"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This breaking change invalidates existing connector offsets and a new snapshot will be triggered by default when upgrading. If a snapshot is not needed or wanted, you will need to adjust your connector configuration&#8217;s <code>snapshot.mode</code> accordingly.</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="debezium_embedded_engine_deprecated_apis_removed">Debezium Embedded Engine Deprecated APIs removed</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Part of the team&#8217;s focus in Debezium 2.5 was to improve the Debezium Embedded Engine&#8217;s experience. With that goal in mind, we took this preview release as an opportunity to clean-up the embedded engine&#8217;s API.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If your usage of the Debezium Embedded Engine utilized any of the previously deprecated APIs on <code>EmbeddedEngine</code>, you will find those methods have since been removed. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7110">DBZ-7100</a>) The recommended path forward is to make sure that you&#8217;re using the <code>DebeziumEngine</code> interface provided by the <code>debezium-api</code> artifact.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="mysql_5_7_support_now_best_effort">MySQL 5.7 support now best-effort</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MySQL community announced that MySQL 5.7 would enter its End of Life cycle at the end of October 2023, or just last month. This means that the MySQL community has no plans to continue offering security or bug fix patches for that edition of MySQL.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In accordance with this upstream community news, Debezium too is making adjustments, like other vendors, around this recent news. To that end, starting with Debezium 2.5, we will no longer be testing nor supporting MySQL 5.7 if full capacity, thus MySQL 5.7 enters what we call "best-effort" support. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6874">DBZ-6874</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="cloudevents_configuration_option_renamed">CloudEvents - configuration option renamed</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are presently using the CloudEvents converter to emit events that conform to the CloudEvents format, it&#8217;s important to note that the configuration option <code>metadata.location</code> was renamed to <code>metadata.source</code>. You will need to be sure to update your connector configurations to reflect this change with Debezium 2.5 and onward.

Over the last several months, this connector has seen numerous iterations to improve its stability, feature set, and capabilities. Debezium 2.5 builds atop of those efforts, introducing batch-writes. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6317">DBZ-6317</a>)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In previous versions, the connector worked on each topic event separately; however, the new batch-write support mode will collect the events into buckets and write those changes to the target system using the fewest possible transaction boundaries as possible. This change increases the connector&#8217;s throughput capabilities and makes the interactions with the target database far more efficient.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="seamless_mongodb_large_document_handling">Seamless MongoDB large document handling</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium has introduced several changes around large document processing in recent releases; however, those changes primarily focused on handling that use case with MongoDB 4 and 5. While these improvements certainly help for those older versions, the MongoDB community has introduced a way in MongoDB 6 to seamlessly deal with this at the database pipeline level.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5&#8217;s MongoDB connector now uses the <code>$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent</code> aggregation feature, introduced as part of MongoDB 6.0.9. This avoids the <code>BSONObjectTooLarge</code> exception when working with documents that would exceed the 16MB document size limit of MongoDB. This new feature is controlled by the <code>oversize.handling.mode</code> option, which defaults to <code>fail</code>. Please adjust this configuration if you would like to take advantage of this new, opt-in feature. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6726">DBZ-6726</a>)</p> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i> </td> <td class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium is simply utilizing an underlying feature of the MongoDB database. As such, the database still has some limitations discussed in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/reference/operator/aggregation/changeStreamSplitLargeEvent/#behavior">MongoDB documentation</a> that could still lead to exceptions with large documents that don&#8217;t adhere to MongoDB&#8217;s split rules.</p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="mysql_8_2_support">MySQL 8.2 support</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MySQL community recently released a new innovation release, MySQL 8.2.0 at the end of October 2023. This new release has been tested with Debezium and we&#8217;re happy to announce that we officially support this new innovation release. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6873">DBZ-6873</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="sql_server_notification_improvements">SQL Server Notification Improvements</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium for SQL Server works by reading the changes captured by the database in what are called capture instances. These instances can come and go based on a user&#8217;s needs, and it can be difficult to know if Debezium has concluded its own capture process for a given capture instance.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5 remedies this problem by emitting a new notification aggregate called <code>Capture Instance</code>, allowing any observer to realize when a capture instance is no longer in use by Debezium. This new notification includes a variety of connector details including the connector&#8217;s name along with the start, stop, and commit LSN values. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7043">DBZ-7043</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="redis_schema_history_retries_now_limited">Redis Schema History Retries now Limited</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 2.5 introduces a new configuration option, <code>schema.history.internal.redis.max.attempts</code> designed to limit the number of retry attempts while connecting to a Redis database when it becomes unavailable, previously it simply retried forever. This new option defaults to <code>10</code> but is user configurable. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7120">DBZ-7120</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="sql_server_driver_updates">SQL Server Driver Updates</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>SQL Serer 2019 introduced the ability to specify column-specific sensitivity classifications to provide better visibility and protections for sensitive data. Unfortunately, the current driver shipped with Debezium 2.4 and earlier does not support this feature. Debezium 2.5 introduces the latest 12.4.2 SQL Server driver so that users can now take advantage of this feature out of the box. (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7109">DBZ-7109</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="debezium_server_kinesis_sink_improvements">Debezium Server Kinesis Sink Improvements</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium Server Kinesis users will be happy to note that there has been some reliability improvements with the sink adapter with Debezium 2.5. The Kinesis Sink will now automatically retry the delivery of a failed record up to a maximum of 5 attempts before the adapter triggers a failure. This should improve the sink adapter&#8217;s delivery reliability and help situations where a batch of changes may overload the sink&#8217;s endpoint.

Our goal and hope is that we can do this within the scope of the MySQL connector proper; however, there is still quite a bit of ongoing investigation around GTID support that may influence the path forward.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This first preview build of Debezium 2.5 has taken the first step, we&#8217;ve verified that the code works against a single MariaDB database deployment, the test suite passes and we&#8217;ve addressed any changes needed with the Binlog client to support that deployment. Our next steps is to look into GTID support, which MariaDB supports but using an approach that isn&#8217;t compatible with MySQL.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Stay tuned for future builds as we continue to expand on this and we certainly welcome any early feedback.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="oracle_streaming_metrics_changes">Oracle Streaming Metrics Changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In previous builds of Debezium, there was a single Oracle streaming metrics bean that exposed all metrics options that spanned across all three streaming adapters. This often lead to some confusion about what metrics are applicable to which streaming adapter so we wanted to define a clear distinction in this case.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Debezium 2.5, the Oracle streaming metrics beans have been split into three different implementations, one for each adapter type. For observability stacks, this change should be completely transparent unless you were previously gathering a metric for one adapter type while using another.

I am pleased to announce that today we have released Debezium 2.5.0.Alpha1, the first preview release of Debezium&#8217;s 2.5 release stream. This release includes many new exciting features as well as bug fixes, e.g. a brand-new IBM Informix connector, a preview support for MariaDB with the MySQL connector, improvements to the Debezium Server operator, Kafka 3.6.0 support, and much more. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at these changes and features that are included in Debezium 2.5.0.Alpha1; as always, you can find the complete list of changes for this release in the release notes. Please take special note of any breaking changes that could affect your upgrade path. IBM Informix Connector Thanks to the contribution from Lars Johansson, Debezium 2.5 introduces a new connector to its portfolio to gather changes from IBM Informix. IBM Informix is an embeddable, high-performance database for integrating SQL, NoSQL, JSON, time-series, and spatial data in one place. It&#8217;s designed for analytics at the edge, in the cloud, or on premise. The IBM Informix connector is bundled just like any of our community lead connectors, it is available on Maven Central or you can download the plug-in archive from our Debezium 2.5 releases page. The maven artifact coordinates are: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;io.debezium&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;debezium-connector-informix&lt;/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;2.5.0.Alpha1&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; If you would like contribute to the Informix connector, we have added a new repository under the Debezium organization, debezium-connector-informix. I&#8217;d like to thank Lars Johansson for this contribution and his collaboration with the team, kudos! MariaDB preview support The community has leveraged the MySQL connector as an alternative to capture changes from MariaDB for quite some time now; however that compatibility was primarily best-case effort. The Debezium 2.5 release stream aims to bring MariaDB to the forefront as a first-class connector by taking a very clear and methodological approach to incrementally check, validate, and eventually support MariaDB at the same capacity that we do MySQL. Our goal and hope is that we can do this within the scope of the MySQL connector proper; however, there is still quite a bit of ongoing investigation around GTID support that may influence the path forward. This first preview build of Debezium 2.5 has taken the first step, we&#8217;ve verified that the code works against a single MariaDB database deployment, the test suite passes and we&#8217;ve addressed any changes needed with the Binlog client to support that deployment. Our next steps is to look into GTID support, which MariaDB supports but using an approach that isn&#8217;t compatible with MySQL. Stay tuned for future builds as we continue to expand on this and we certainly welcome any early feedback. Oracle Streaming Metrics Changes In previous builds of Debezium, there was a single Oracle streaming metrics bean that exposed all metrics options that spanned across all three streaming adapters. This often lead to some confusion about what metrics are applicable to which streaming adapter so we wanted to define a clear distinction in this case. With Debezium 2.5, the Oracle streaming metrics beans have been split into three different implementations, one for each adapter type. For observability stacks, this change should be completely transparent unless you were previously gathering a metric for one adapter type while using another. In this case you&#8217;ll find that metric is no longer available. Specifically for LogMiner users, several metrics have been renamed and the old metrics have been deprecated. While you will still be able to use the old metric names in Debezium 2.5, these are scheduled for removal in a future 2.7+ build. The metrics that were deprecated and renamed are as follows: Old/Deprecated Metric New Metric CurrentRedoLogFileName CurrentLogFileNames RedoLogStatus RedoLogStatuses SwitchCounter LogSwitchCounter FetchingQueryCount FetchQueryCount HoursToKeepTransactionInBuffer MillisecondsToKeepTransactionsInBuffer TotalProcessingTimeInMilliseconds TotalBatchProcessingTimeInMilliseconds RegisteredDmlCount TotalChangesCount MillisecondsToSleepBetweenMiningQuery SleepTimeInMilliseconds NetworkConnectionProblemsCounter No replacement Debezium Server Operator The Debezium Server Operator for Kubernetes has been actively improved in this preview release of Debezium 2.5. Several improvements include: Ability to set image pull secrets in the CRDs DBZ-6962 Ability to set resource limits in the CRDs DBZ-7052 Published OLM bundle scripts to Maven Central DBZ-6995 Support OKD/OpenShift catalog in OperatorHub release script DBZ-7010 Display name and descriptions metadata available in OLM bundle DBZ-7011 New metrics endpoint for gathering metrics DBZ-7053 As we continue to improve the Debezium Server Operator for Kubernetes, we&#8217;d love to get your feedback. Community connectors Additionally, there were several enhancements to our community led connectors for Google Spanner and Vitess, which include the following changes: Support for Cloud Spanner emulator with the Spanner connector DBZ-6845 Resumable snapshot support for the Vitess connector DBZ-7050 Other fixes In addition, there were quite a number of stability and bug fixes that made it into this release. These include the following: Adding Debezium Server example using MySQL and GCP PubSub DBZ-4471 Refactor ElapsedTimeStrategy DBZ-6778 Multiple debezium:offsets Redis clients DBZ-6952 Wrong case-behavior for non-avro column name in sink connector DBZ-6958 Handle properly bytea field for jdbc sink to postgresql DBZ-6967 Debezium jdbc sink process truncate event failure DBZ-6970 Single quote replication includes escaped quotes for N(CHAR/VARCHAR) columns DBZ-6975 Provide configuration option to exclude extension attributes from a CloudEvent DBZ-6982 Debezium jdbc sink should throw not supporting schema change topic exception DBZ-6990 Debezium doesn&#8217;t compile with JDK 21 DBZ-6992 OLM bundle version for GA releases is invalid DBZ-6994 Further refactoring to correct downstream rendering of incremental snapshots topics DBZ-6997 ALTER TABLE fails when adding multiple columns to JDBC sink target DBZ-6999 Invalid Link to zulip chat in CSV metadata DBZ-7000 Make sure to terminate the task once connectivity is lost to either the rebalance or sync topic DBZ-7001 Missing .metadata.annotations.repository field in CSV metadata DBZ-7003 Single quote replication and loss of data DBZ-7006 Remove deprecated embedded engine code DBZ-7013 Enable replication slot advance check DBZ-7015 Add configuration option to CloudEventsConverter to retrieve id and type from headers DBZ-7016 Oracle connector: Payload size over 76020 bytes are getting truncated DBZ-7018 Use optional schema for Timezone Converter tests DBZ-7020 DDL statement couldn&#8217;t be parsed DBZ-7030 Blocking ad-hoc snapshot is not really blocking for MySQL DBZ-7035 Fake ROTATE event on connection restart cleans metadata DBZ-7037 Consolidate resource labels and annotations DBZ-7064 Altogether, XX issues were fixed for this release.

There are currently two ways to deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster. You can either apply a set of Kubernetes manifests to your cluster (similarly to what we did with the database and the Strimzi operator), or directly from the <a href="https://operatorhub.io/">OperatorHub</a> operator catalog.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="deploying_debezium_operator_from_operator_catalog">Deploying Debezium Operator from Operator Catalog</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In this section we will use the <a href="https://olm.operatorframework.io/">Operator Lifecycle Manager</a> to create a subscription to the operator available in the <a href="https://operatorhub.io/">OperatorHub catalog</a>. As we mentioned previously, Debezium is one of the <a href="https://operatorhub.io/operator/debezium-operator">available operators</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Among other things, using OLM also allows you to configure the scope of namespaces watched by the operator from a single namespace to the entire cluster. However, <a href="https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-tasks/operator-scoping-with-operatorgroups/">this configuration</a> is out of the scope (pun intended!) for this tutorial. The process below will install the operator into the <code>operators</code> namespace&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is by default intended for cluster-wide operators.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>First we need to install OLM itself by running the following shell commands&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;skip this if OLM is already installed in your cluster.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This is a one-time process and any production k8s cluster which provides access to operator catalogs would already have OLM installed.</p> </div> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl -L https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.25.0/install.sh -o install.sh

In this article, we continue our exploration of Debezium signaling and notifications. In particular, we will delve into how to enable and manage these features using the JMX channel.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We will also explore how to send signals and get notifications through the REST API leveraging Jolokia.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p></p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="interact_with_debezium_via_jmx">Interact with Debezium via JMX</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>JMX stands for Java Management Extensions, a Java technology for managing and monitoring Java applications. It provides a standardized way to monitor application performance, configure settings, and interact with running Java applications using various management tools and clients. JMX is particularly useful for managing and monitoring complex, distributed, and enterprise-level Java applications.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="enable_signaling_via_jmx_channel">Enable signaling via JMX channel</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Signaling in Debezium is about triggering actions to execute operations during normal execution. As discussed in previous articles, Debezium offers different out-of-the-box signal channels. In this article, we will focus on the JMX channel.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To start using the JMX signal channel, we need to:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Enable JMX server on Kafka Connect service</p> </li> <li> <p>Add <code>jmx</code> to <code>signal.enabled.channels</code> connector configuration property</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a JMX client to connect to JMX server to send signal.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium exposes the signal MBean named <code>debezium.&lt;connector-type&gt;:type=management,context=signals,server=&lt;server&gt;</code>. This bean exposes <code>signal</code> operations that accept three parameters:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>p0: The id of the signal.</p> </li> <li> <p>p1: The type of the signal, for example, execute-snapshot.</p> </li> <li> <p>p2: A JSON data field that contains additional information about the specified signal type.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="enable_notifications_via_jmx_channel">Enable notifications via JMX channel</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Notifications are pivotal in informing you about what happens in Debezium.
