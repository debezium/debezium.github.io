Debezium has received a huge improvement to the structure of its container images link:/blog/2019/06/03/debezium-0-10-0-alpha2-released/[recently],
making it extremely simple to extend its behaviour.

This is a small tutorial showing how you can for instance add https://sentry.io/welcome/[Sentry],
"an open-source error tracking [software] that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time".
Here we'll use it to collect and report any exceptions from Kafka Connect and its connectors.
Note that this is only applicable for Debezium 0.9+.

We need a few things to have Sentry working, and we'll add all of them and later have a Dockerfile which gets it all glued correctly:

- Configure Log4j
- SSL certificate for https://sentry.io[sentry.io], since it's not by default in the JVM trusted chain
- The `sentry` and `sentry-log4j` libraries

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Log4j Configuration

Let's create a file _config/log4j.properties_ in our local project which is a copy of the one shipped with Debezium images and add Sentry to it.
Note we added `Sentry` to `log4j.rootLogger` and created the section `log4j.appender.Sentry`, the rest remains as the original configuration:

[source,config]
----
kafka.logs.dir=logs

log4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout, appender, Sentry

# Disable excessive reflection warnings - KAFKA-5229
log4j.logger.org.reflections=ERROR

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.threshold=INFO
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-5p  %X{dbz.connectorType}|%X{dbz.connectorName}|%X{dbz.connectorContext}  %m   [%c]%n

log4j.appender.appender=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.appender.DatePattern='.'yyyy-MM-dd-HH
log4j.appender.appender.File=${kafka.logs.dir}/connect-service.log
log4j.appender.appender.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.appender.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-5p  %X{dbz.connectorType}|%X{dbz.connectorName}|%X{dbz.connectorContext}  %m   [%c]%n

log4j.appender.Sentry=io.sentry.log4j.SentryAppender
log4j.appender.Sentry.threshold=WARN

----

== Sentry.io SSL certificate

Download the _getsentry.pem_ file from https://docs.sentry.io/ssl/[sentry.io] and put it in your project's directory under _ssl/_.

== The Dockerfile

Now we can glue everything together in our Debezium image:

- Let's first create a JKS file with our Sentry certificate; this uses a Docker multi-stage building process, where we are generating a `certificates.jks` which we'll later copy into our Kafka Connect with Debezium stage
- Copy `log4j.properties` into `$KAFKA_HOME/config/log4j.properties`
- Copy the JKS file from the multi-stage build
- Set ENV with the Sentry version and m5sums
- Download Sentry dependencies, the script you see called `docker-maven-download` is a helper which we ship by default in our images.
In this case we're using it to download a JAR file from Maven Central and put it in the Kafka libs directory.
We do that by setting the ENV var `MAVEN_DEP_DESTINATION=$KAFKA_HOME/libs`:

[source,dockerfile,docker]
----
FROM fabric8/java-centos-openjdk8-jdk:1.6 as ssl-jks

ARG JKS_STOREPASS="any random password, you can also set it outside via the arguments from docker build"

USER root:root

COPY /ssl /ssl

RUN chown -R jboss:jboss /ssl

USER jboss:jboss

WORKDIR /ssl

RUN keytool -import -noprompt -alias getsentry \
    -storepass "${JKS_STOREPASS}" \
    -keystore certificates.jks \
    -trustcacerts -file "/ssl/getsentry.pem"

FROM debezium/connect:0.10 AS kafka-connect

EXPOSE 8083

COPY config/log4j.properties "$KAFKA_HOME/config/log4j.properties"

COPY --from=ssl-jks --chown=kafka:kafka /ssl/certificates.jks /ssl/

ENV SENTRY_VERSION=1.7.23 \
    MAVEN_DEP_DESTINATION=$KAFKA_HOME/libs

RUN docker-maven-download \
        central io/sentry sentry "$SENTRY_VERSION" 4bf1d6538c9c0ebc22526e2094b9bbde && \
    docker-maven-download \
        central io/sentry sentry-log4j "$SENTRY_VERSION" 74af872827bd7e1470fd966449637a77
----

== Build and Run

Now we can simply build the image:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker build -t debezium/connect-sentry:1 --build-arg=JKS_STOREPASS="123456789" .
----

When running the image we have now to configure our Kafka Connect application to load the JKS file by setting `KAFKA_OPTS: -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/ssl/certificates.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<YOUR TRUSTSTORE PASSWORD>`.

Sentry can be https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/config/#id2[configured in many ways], I like to do it via environment variables, the minimum we can set is the Sentry DSN (which is necessary to point to your project) and the actual running environment name (i.e.: production, staging).

In this case we can configure the variables: `SENTRY_DSN=<GET THE DNS IN SENTRY'S DASHBOARD>`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=dev`.

In case you'd like to learn more about using the Debezium container images, please link:/docs/tutorial/#starting_docker[check our tutorial].

And that's it, a basic  a recipe for extending our Docker setup using Sentry as an example;
other modifications should also be as simple as this one.
As an example how a `RecordTooLarge` exception from the Kafka producer would look like in this setup, see the picture below:

<div class="imageblock centered-image">
    <img src="/assets/images/sentry/example-record-too-large-exception.png" class="responsive-image" alt="Sentry Exception example">
</div>

== Conclusion

Thanks to the recent refactor of the Debezium container images, it got very easy to amend them with your custom extensions.
Downloading external dependencies and adding them to the images became a trivial task and we'd love to hear your feedback about it!

If you are curious about the refactoring itself, you can find the details in pull request https://github.com/debezium/docker-images/pull/131[debezium/docker-images#131].
