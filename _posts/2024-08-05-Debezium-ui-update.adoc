# Status of Debezium UI

Hello everyone, Jakub here. You may have noticed that there wasn't much happening around Debezium UI lately. 
This, however, would be only partially true. We own you an explanation in this regard, so please bare with me. 

Let's start with the status of the **current** UI project. It became increasing clear that while UI
for Debezium is an important part of our vision, developing a UI strictly tied to Kafka Connect is 
not the right direction. It was thus decied to freeze the development of the **current** web UI 
project. There were two main reasons for this decision: 

1. The team doesn't have the bandwith (nor the desire) to develop a general purpose Kafka connector UI which would 
be on par with some of the existing offerings (e.g. Lenses). So our UI would only ever be able to work with Debezium connectors specifically.
2. Debezium Server is gaining popularity and we would like to offer a user friendly way of managing this flavour of Debezium as well. 
Unfortunetly, the deployment model of Debezium Server is very different from deploying Debezium as a connector. 

## What's Next?
As the previous paragraph mentioned the **current** UI, it's probably not a suprise that we did not give up on the idea. Part of the decision
was to explore a possibility of creating a new UI which while still focused exclusively on Debezium would gradually support multiple deployment
models. The idea is to start with Debezium Server deployed on Kubernetes, followed by bare metal deployment of Debezium Server.
At some point in the future we would like to cycle back to Kafka Connect and support also the deployment and operation of Debezium as Kafka
Connect connectors.

## Designing the New UI
One of the goals we defined for ourselves when designing the new platform was to simplify the understanding of what Debezium does.
For this purpuse we are going to abstract away from the underlying deployment model. Instead of focusing on servers and connectors,
we want to allow our users to think about Debezum in terms of data. Thus the new generation of the UI should operate with data pipelines
-- you define the source, the destination and any data transformations.

These can be then composed into a deployable pipeline. Depending on the target environment (Kafka Connect, Kubernetes, bare metal),
an appropriate deployment will be used.

When  pipeline is deployed to a Kubernetes or a bare metal machine

- The Source is the configuration of the Debezium Source connector
- Transformations are the usual SMTs
- The Destination coresponds to the configuration of Debezium Server's Sink.

When pipeline is deployed to Kafka Connect

- The Source is the configuration of the Debezium Source connector
- Transformations are the usual SMTs
- The destination is always Kafka topic 

In the future, we could also allow our JDBC and MongoDB sink connectors to be used as a destination, allowing for truly end-to-end defined pipelines
when Kafka Connect is targeted.

## Where Do We Stand Right Now
We are at the begining of this journey. Nevetheless, there is a rough PoC prototype ready for you to https://github.com/debezium/debezium-platform-conductor/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-compose-kind-kafka-example[examine].
As already briefly mentioned, initially the plan is to target only Kubernetes as supported deployment environment, more specifically
Debezium Server on Kubernetes. This choice allows us to take an advantage of our Debezium Operator.

We intend to introduce configuration and feature support gradually. Thus the configuration is deliberately opinionated and
simplistic -- currently all pipelines can only use ephemeral storages. In this early version all configuration properties also
must be set a simple key-value pairs. This will change, as the next step we intend to provide auto-completion for property names,
and ultimately fully specialised forms will be rendered.

## We need your help!
At the end of this short report, we would like to ask you to try this early PoC and let us know your opinion.
We would especially appreciate if you could let as know your answers to the following questions:

- What features are a must for you?
- What features would you consider nice to have?
- What is your visual impression?  

Thank you and expect to hear from us soon with more updates to come!
