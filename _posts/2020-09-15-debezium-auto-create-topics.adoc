When you are working with Kafka Connect Distributed then you might have realized that once you start
Kafka Connect there are already some internal Kafka Connect related topics created for you:

[source,options="nowrap",shell]
----
$ kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server $HOSTNAME:9092 --list

connect_configs
connect_offsets
connect_statuses
----

This is done automatically for you by Kafka Connect with a sane, customized default topic configuration
that fits the needs of these internal topics.

When you start a Debezium connector the topics for the captured events are created by the Kafka
broker based on a default, maybe customized, configuration in the broker if
`auto.create.topics.enable = true` is enabled in the broker config:

[source,options="nowrap",shell]
----
auto.create.topics.enable = true
default.replication.factor = 1
num.partitions = 1
compression.type = producer
log.cleanup.policy = delete
log.retention.ms = 604800000  ## 7 days
----

But often, when you use Debezium and Kafka in a production environment you might choose to disable
Kafka's topic auto creation capability with `auto.create.topics.enable = false`, or you want the
connector topics to be configured differently from the default. In this case you have to create
topics for Debezium's captured data sources upfront.{empty} +
But there's good news! Beginning with Kafka Connect version 2.6.0, this can be automated since
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-158%3A+Kafka+Connect+should+allow+source+connectors+to+set+topic-specific+settings+for+new+topics[KIP-158]
is implemented to enable customizable topic creation with Kafka Connect.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Kafka Connect

Kafka Connect since Kafka 2.6.0 comes with topic creation enabled:

[source,options="nowrap",shell]
----
topic.creation.enable = true
----

If you don't want to allow automatic topic creation by connectors you can set this value to `false`
in the Kafka Connect config (_connect-distributed.properties_ file or via environment variable
_CONNECT_TOPIC_CREATION_ENABLE_ when using https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/connect[Debezium's container image for Kafka Connect]).

== Updating Connector Configuration

Kafka Connect topic creation works with groups. There's always a `default` group which is used when
there's no other group defined that matches the topic.

Every group can specify a collection of topic configuration properties, and a regular expression list
of topic names that config should apply to.

You can specify all https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs[*topic level configuration parameters*]
to customize how the matched topics of the group will be created.

Let's see how we can extend this Postgres config for the Kafka Connect topic creation:

[source,options="nowrap",json]
----
{
    "name": "inventory-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
        "tasks.max": 1,
        "database.hostname": "postgres",
        "database.port": 5432,
        "database.user": "postgres",
        "database.password": "postgres",
        "database.dbname" : "postgres",
        "database.server.name": "dbserver1",
        "schema.include.list": "inventory"
    }
}
----

=== Default Config

All topics not matching other `topic.creation` groups will apply the `default` group
config.{empty} +
As default we want `replication.factor = 3`, `partitions = 10`, the topic should be key
compacted with `cleanup.policy = "compact"`, and all messages should be LZ4 compressed
on harddisk with `compression.type = "lz4"`.{empty} +
So we configure for the default group:

[source,options="nowrap",json]
----
{
    "name": "inventory-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
        "tasks.max": 1,
        "database.hostname": "postgres",
        "database.port": 5432,
        "database.user": "postgres",
        "database.password": "postgres",
        "database.dbname" : "postgres",
        "database.server.name": "dbserver1",
        "schema.include.list": "inventory",

        "topic.creation.default.replication.factor": 3,
        "topic.creation.default.partitions": 10,
        "topic.creation.default.cleanup.policy": "compact",
        "topic.creation.default.compression.type": "lz4"
    }
}
----

=== Productlog Config

In the databases `inventory` schema there are tables starting with `product` as table name.{empty} +
As default the fully qualified table names are captured to the topic with the same name with Debezium,
for example the table `products` in the `inventory` schema of `dbserver1` is captured to the
topic `dbserver1.inventory.products`.

We want that all messages that go to a topic for table names starting with `product` are stored
in a topic with a retention time of 3 months / 90 days with `cleanup.policy": "delete"` and
`retention.ms = 7776000000`, `replication.factor = 1`, `partitions = 20`, and just use the
compression format that's used by the producer `compression.type": "producer"`.{empty} +
You can leave out properties that match the cluster defaults, but be careful once you
change the default config on your Kafka brokers the resulting topic config might differ!

First we need to register a `productlog` group using the `topic.creation.groups` property.{empty} +
Then we can define what topic names should be included in that group and specify the configuration
of our group like we did with the `default` group:

[source,options="nowrap",json]
----
{
    "name": "inventory-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
        "tasks.max": 1,
        "database.hostname": "postgres",
        "database.port": 5432,
        "database.user": "postgres",
        "database.password": "postgres",
        "database.dbname" : "postgres",
        "database.server.name": "dbserver1",
        "schema.include.list": "inventory",
        "topic.creation.default.replication.factor": 3,
        "topic.creation.default.partitions": 10,
        "topic.creation.default.cleanup.policy": "compact",
        "topic.creation.default.compression.type": "lz4",

        "topic.creation.groups": "productlog",  //<1>

        "topic.creation.productlog.include": "dbserver1\\.inventory\\.product.*",  //<2>
        "topic.creation.productlog.replication.factor": 1,
        "topic.creation.productlog.partitions": 20,
        "topic.creation.productlog.cleanup.policy": "delete",
        "topic.creation.productlog.retention.ms": 7776000000,
        "topic.creation.productlog.compression.type": "producer"
    }
}

.Connector Configuration for customized automatic topic creation
[cols="1,9",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Description

|1
|`topic.creation.groups` defines a comma-separated list of additional group names. Here we only
define our `productlog` group.

|2
|The `topic.creation.productlog.include` field holds a comma-separated list of regular expressions
that match the topic names where the `productlog` group config should be applied. The `productlog`
group matches all topics starting with `dbserver1.inventory.product`.

|===

=== Exploring the Results

When we now start our connector and use `kafka-topics.sh` to see how the topics were created, we can
see that all worked as defined:

[source,options="nowrap",shell]
----
## the `dbserver1.inventory.products` topic has the config from the `productlog` group:
$ kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server $HOSTNAME:9092 --describe --topic dbserver1.inventory.products

Topic: dbserver1.inventory.products     PartitionCount: 20      ReplicationFactor: 1
Configs: compression.type=producer,cleanup.policy=delete,retention.ms=7776000000,segment.bytes=1073741824

## the `dbserver1.inventory.orders` topic has the config from the `default` group:
$ kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server $HOSTNAME:9092 --describe --topic dbserver1.inventory.orders

Topic: dbserver1.inventory.orders       PartitionCount: 10       ReplicationFactor: 3
Configs: compression.type=lz4,cleanup.policy=compact,segment.bytes=1073741824,delete.retention.ms=2592000000

== Conclusion

In many, especially in production environments we often don't want topic auto creation to be enabled
on the Kafka broker side, or we need a different configuration than the default topic config.{empty} +
Prior Kafka 2.6 this was only possible when manually creating topics upfront or by some custom setup
process, maybe during deployment.

Since Kafka 2.6 Kafka Connect comes with built-in topic creation for connector topics and this article
shows how to use it with Debezium.

You can find an example https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/topic-auto-create[here]
in the Debezium examples repository on GitHub.
