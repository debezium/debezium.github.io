In the realm of data streaming optimization, even subtle improvements can make a significant impact. This article focuses on one such refinement: the introduction of batch support in Debezium's JDBC connector.
We'll guide you through the process of enabling batches and share the practical outcomes of our performance testing.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Configuring batches
Since our previous releases were primarily focused on core functionalities, our latest release is dedicated to addressing the main pain point associated with the connector: performance.

The goal was to improve throughput in terms of events processed per second (EPS).
To achieve this, we revisited the connector to enable the processing of batches of events.

You can now fine-tune the size of the batch using a new property: `batch.size`.

The `batch.size` property defines the number of records to be *attempted* for batching into the destination table.
However, it's crucial to note that the actual size of processed records is contingent upon the `consumer.max.poll.records` property of the Kafka Connect worker.

It's important to be aware that if you set `consumer.max.poll.records` in the Connect worker properties to a value lower than `batch.size`, batch processing will be constrained by `consumer.max.poll.records`, and the intended `batch.size` may not be achieved.

=== Configure consumer max poll records
If you prefer not to configure the `consumer.max.poll.records` property globally on the Connect worker, you have the option to set the underlying consumer's `max.poll.records` for a specific connector using `consumer.override.max.poll.records` in the connector configuration.

To enable per-connector configuration properties and override the default worker properties, add the following parameter to the worker properties file: `connector.client.config.override.policy` https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/references/allconfigs.html#override-the-worker-configuration[(see override-the-worker-configuration)].

This property defines which configurations can be overridden by the connector. The default implementation is `All`, but other possible policies include `None` and `Principal`.

When `connector.client.config.override.policy=All`, each connector belonging to the worker is permitted to override the worker configuration. You can now utilize the following override prefixes for sink connector configurations: `consumer.override.<sink-configuration-property>`.

It's worth noting that even if you set `max.poll.records` (with the default value of 500), you may receive fewer records. This is due to other properties that can impact record fetching from the topic/partitions.

*Name*: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_fetch.max.bytes[fetch.max.bytes] +
*Default*: 52428800 (52MB) +

*Name*: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_max.partition.fetch.bytes[max.partition.fetch.bytes] +
*Default*: 1048576 (1MB) +

*Name*: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_message.max.bytes[message.max.bytes] +
*Default*: 1048588 (1MB) +

*Name*: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs_max.message.bytes[max.message.bytes] +
*Default*: 1048588 (1MB) +

So adjust these based on your expected payload size to reach the desired number of poll records.

== Results from performance testing
The objective of the performance tests was to provide a sense of how batch support improved the EPS.
Therefore, these numbers do not reflect any real scenario but rather showcase relative improvements compared to the old JDBC version.

=== Configuration used for the tests
All tests executed on a *ThinkPad T14s Gen 2i*

*CPU*: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz (8 cores) +
*RAM*: 32GB +
*Disk*: 512GB NVMe +

All required components (Kafka, Connect, Zookeeper, etc.) inside docker containers.

The table used for the test has the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `aviation` (
  `id` int NOT NULL,
  `aircraft` longtext,
  `airline` longtext,
  `passengers` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `airport` longtext,
  `flight` longtext,
  `metar` longtext,
  `flight_distance` double DEFAULT NULL
)
```

=== Test plan
We planned to execute these tests:

* 100K events from single table
** Baseline without batch for (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer)
** MySQL batch vs without batch
* 100K events from three different table
** MySQL batch vs without batch
* 1M events from single table
** MySQL batch with batch size: 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 vs without batch
** MySQL batch with batch size: 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 with JSONConverter
** MySQL batch with batch size: 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 with Avro
** MySQL batch with batch size: 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 with Avro and no index on destination table

_Figure 1_ illustrates the total execution time required to process 100,000 events from a single table, comparing different connectors without batch support and the MySQL connector with the default batch size.

[NOTE]
====
Despite the default values being set to `500` for both `batch.size` and `consumer.max.poll.records`, the observed actual size was reduced to `337` records due to payload size considerations.

We can observe two things:

* There are difference between different connectors
