It's my pleasure to announce the second release of the Debezium 1.7 series, *1.7.0.Beta1*!

This release brings https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats-streaming/streaming#nats-streaming-overview[NATS Streaming]
support for Debezium Server along with many other fixes and enhancements.
Also this release is the first one tested with Apache Kafka 2.8.

+++<!-- more -->+++

The Debezium container images for https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/kafka[Apache Kafka]
and https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/connect[Kafka Connect] have been updated to
version 2.8, too. This means that you can test Debezium with the new ZooKeeper-less
mode for running Kafka (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum[KIP-500]).
We'll share more details on that in a separate post shortly.

A large number of bug fixes and quality improvements have been made for this release;
one focus area was the Debezium connector for Oracle, which received several fixes including the ability to configure multiple Oracle RAC nodes with different ports (DBZ-3813), multiple DDL parser corrections (DBZ-3877, DBZ-3893), and improved updating of SCN offsets (DBZ-3876).

Other changes include performance improvement for the Debezium connectors for Postgres (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3870[DBZ-3870]) and MongoDB
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3788[DBZ-3788]),
proper timezone conversions for change event timestamps in the connector for SQL Server (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3479[DBZ-3479]),
and more resilient handling of errors during connector start-up (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3823[DBZ-3823]).

Furthermore, this release has a breaking change for the MySQL Connector.
The MySQL driver was updated to the latest version 8.0.26 with https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-3833[DBZ-3833].
This update comes with a new timezone handling and configuration options.
Detailed information can be found in the https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-connp-props-datetime-types-processing.html[MySQL docs].

Earlier this month, we added the https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/operations/debezium-ui.html[Debezium UI]
to our regular release process. If you want to learn more about the Debezium UI have a look at our
recent link:/blog/2021/08/12/introducing-debezium-ui/[release announcement].

Overall, https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12359667[81 issues] were fixed for this release.
