Hello everyone, my name is Chris Cranford and I recently joined the Debezium team.

My journey at Red Hat began just over three years ago; however I have been in this line of work for nearly
twenty years.  All throughout my career, I have advocated and supported open source software.  Many of my
initial software endeavors were based on open source software, several which are still heavily used today
such as http://www.hibernate.org[Hibernate ORM].

When I first joined Red Hat, I had the pleasure to work on the Hibernate ORM team. I had been an end user
of the project since 2.0, so it was an excellent fit to be able to contribute full time to a project that
had served me well in the corporate world n-times over.

It wasn't long ago when http://twitter.com/gunnarmorling[@gunnarmorling] and I had a brief exchange about
Debezium.  I had not heard of the project and I was super stoked because I immediately saw parallel in
its goals and http://www.hibernate.org/orm/envers[Hibernate Envers], a change data capture solution that
is based on Hibernate's event framework that I was currently maintaining.

I believe one of my first "wow" moments was when I realized how well Debezium fits into the micro-services
world.  The idea of being able to share data between micro-services in a very decoupled way is a massive
win for building reusable components and minimizes technical debt.

Debezium just felt like the next logical step.  There are so many new and exciting things to come and
the team and myself cannot wait to share them.

So lets get started!
