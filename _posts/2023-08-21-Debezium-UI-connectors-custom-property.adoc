The Debezium UI team continues to add support for more features, allowing users to configure connectors more easily. In this article, we'll describe and demonstrate how to provide the additional properties for configuration that the UI does not expose by default.
Read further for more information!

== Need for custom properties step

Debezium is very flexible - each connector can be configured and fine-tuned in various ways. Debezium UI already exposes an extensive list of properties that are segregated under different steps for configuration. However, despite the UI exposing a wide range of properties, there are situations where additional custom properties may be necessary beyond those exposed out of the box. For example, `producer.*`, `consumer.*`, and even `driver.*` properties are pass-through configuration options for configuring parts of the Kafka Connect pipeline or the JDBC driver, respectively.

*Example*
 
Debezium must configure the Kafka producer settings to write schema change events to the schema history topic for connectors that utilize a schema history topic, like MySQL. The connector configuration includes a subset of options that act as pass-through properties that begin with the `schema.history.internal.producer.*` prefix.

Debezium strips the prefix from the property names before passing the properties to the Kafka client.

== Custom properties step

The Debezium UI allows you to configure additional properties for connectors not exposed in the UI. For this, we have created a new extra step called *Custom Properties* in the configuration wizard.

The *custom properties* step allows you to provide the additional properties by entering a key-value pair. Once you enter the additional configuration properties `key` and `value`, click the *Apply* button.

When clicking the *Apply* button, the UI validates the user entries and provides feedback if there are any problems. If there are no problems, the UI will show a green check icon on the right side of all the successfully added additional properties. You can also remove any added property by clicking on the *Remove* button on the right side of the property.

On the left-hand side, you can see the list of already configured properties from the previous wizard step, and the newly added custom properties in this step are highlighted in *blue* color.

In the screenshot above, the user added `schema.history.internal.producer.*` related additional properties.


== Self-contained example

You can try out configuring the connector with some custom properties (and more) with our self-contained example https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/main/ui-demo[UI demo] - which is included under https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples[debezium-examples] on GitHub.  The UI demo includes a Docker Compose file, which brings up several sources with data and the UI. Please refer to the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/main/ui-demo[README file] for more details on running the Debezium UI demo.

== More coming soon!

Stay tuned for further improvements and new feature announcements in the UI in the coming releases.
