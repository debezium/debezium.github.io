As you are probably well aware, Gunnar Morling has stepped down from his position as Debezium project lead and is now pursuing new exciting adventures.
It is sad, but every cloud has a silver lining!

What can it be?
We (the Debezium team and Red Hat) are hiring!
Are you a community contributor?
Do you have any pull requests under your belt?
Are you a happy Debezium user and eager to do more, or are you a seasoned Java developer looking for work in an exciting and inclusive open-source environment? 

+++<!-- more -->+++
If any of that describes you, don’t hesitate to contact me (Jiri Pechanec <jpechane@redhat.com>) via email or our Zulip chat.
I cannot promise you will be selected, but I can promise an open and fair process.

The following are a guideline, things we’d love to see but aren’t all required. 
If there are specific expectations, those are indicated inline.

* Multiple years of Java development experience
** JDBC knowledge expected
* Enterprise Java is not required but the knowledge of integration patterns like message bus (JMS), routing, etc. is welcome
* Kafka or Kafka Connect experience is welcome
* At least user knowledge of some of the databases supported by Debezium is preferred
** Basic database concepts like transactions (ACID), and transaction logs are expected
* Open-source contributions are a plus
* Debezium contributions are a huge plus

We can promise engaging and interesting work, an excellent and inclusive team that treats everyone with respect, and a wonderful community that is vibrant and growing daily.

Don’t be shy, and don’t underestimate yourself.
We would rather speak to more people than miss you!
