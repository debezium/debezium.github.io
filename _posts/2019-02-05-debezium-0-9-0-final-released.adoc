I'm delighted to announce the release of Debezium *0.9 Final*!

This release only adds a small number of changes since last week's CR1 release;
most prominently there's some more metrics for the SQL Server connector
(lag behind master, number of transactions etc.)
and two bug fixes related to the handling of partitioned tables in MySQL (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1113[DBZ-1113]) and Postgres (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1118[DBZ-1118]).

Having been in the works for six months after the initial Alpha release,
Debezium 0.9 comes with a brand new link:/docs/connectors/sqlserver/[connector for SQL Server],
lots of new features and improvements for the existing connectors,
updates to the latest versions of Apache Kafka and the supported databases
as well as a wide range of bug fixes.

+++<!-- more -->+++

Some key features of the release besides the aforementioned CDC connector for SQL Server are:

* Initial snapshotting for the Oracle connector (which remains to be a "tech preview" at this point)
* Brand-new metrics for the SQL Server and Oracle connectors and extended metrics for the MySQL connector
* Field filtering and renaming for MongoDB
* A new handler interface for the embedded engine
* Lots of improvements around the "event flattening" SMT for MongoDB
* More detailed source info in CDC events and optional metadata such as a column's source type
* Option to delay snapshots for a given time
* Support for HSTORE columns in Postgres
* Incubating support for picking up changes to the whitelist/blacklist configuration of the MySQL connector

As a teaser on the connector metrics support, here's a screenshot of https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/[Java Mission Control]

It's hard to say which of the changes and new features I'm most excited about,
but one thing surely sticking out is the tremendous amount of community work on this release.

When upgrading from earlier Debezium releases,
please make sure to read the information regarding update procedures and breaking changes in the link:/docs/releases/[release notes].
One relevant change to the users of the Debezium connector for MySQL is that our new Antlr-based DDL parser is used by default now.
After lots of honing we felt it's time for using the new parser by default now.
While the existing parser can still be used as a fallback as of Debezium 0.9,
it will be phased out in 0.10.

== Next Steps

After some drinks to celebrate this release, the plan is to do a 0.9.1 release rather quickly
(probably in two weeks from now),
providing improvements and potential bug fixes to the features and changes done in 0.9.
We'll also begin the work on Debezium 0.10,
stay tuned for the details on that!

For further plans beyond that, take a look at our link:/docs/roadmap/[road map].
