Did you know December 12th is National Ding-a-Ling Day?
It's the day to call old friends you haven't heard from in a while.
So we thought we'd get in touch (not that is has been *that* long) with our friends, i.e. you, and share the news about the release of Debezium *1.0.0.CR1*!

It's the first, and ideally only, candidate release; so Debezium 1.0 should be out very soon.
Quite a few nice features found their way into CR1:

* A SerDe (serializer/deserializer) for link:/documentation/reference/1.0/configuration/serdes.html[working with JSON-formatted change data events] in Kafka Streams (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1533[DBZ-1533])
* Advanced type support for Postgres: the long awaited enum types (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-920[DBZ-920]), domain types (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1413[DBZ-1413]) and arrays of UUIDs (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1637[DBZ-1637])
* Graceful handling of MongoDB 4.0 transaction events (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1215[DBZ-1215])
* Full support for Java 11, including the upgrade to Java 11 in the Debezium container images for Apache Kafka and Connect (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-969[DBZ-969], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1402[DBZ-1402])

+++<!-- more -->+++

There was a number of bug fixes, too:

* Graceful handling of an empty history topic for the MySQL connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1201[DBZ-1201])
* Correct column filtering for SQL Server connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1617[DBZ-1617])
* Support for `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME ...` in MySQL (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1645[DBZ-1645])

As were're approaching the 1.0 Final release, we also took the time to check the configuration options of the different connectors for consistency.
Things were in pretty good shape already due to previous work towards unification in Debezium 0.10.
Only for the SQL Server and Oracle connectors, the snapshot mode "initial_schema_only" has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use "schema_only" instead, as known from the MySQL connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-585[DBZ-585]).

Overall, this release contains link:/releases/1.0/release-notes/#release-1.0.0-cr1[24 changes].
As always, this release wouldn't have been possible without the help from folks of the community:
https://github.com/pan3793[Cheng Pan],
https://github.com/collinvandyck[Collin Van Dyck],
https://github.com/gnaazr95[Gurnaaz Randhawa],
https://github.com/grzegorz8[Grzegorz Kołakowski],
https://github.com/ivansjg[Ivan San Jose],
https://github.com/theodesp[Theofanis Despoudis] and
https://github.com/deblockt[Thomas Deblock].

Thanks a lot to you! In total, not less than 144 people have contributed to the Debezium main code repository at this point.
Perhaps we can bump this number to 200 in 2020?

Barring any unforeseen issues, this candidate release should be the only one for Debezium 1.0,
and the final version should be in your hands before Christmas.
So please give the CR a try and let us know how it works for you!
