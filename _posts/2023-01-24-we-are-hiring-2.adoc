In November last year, we link:/blog/2022/11/15/filling-the-ranks/[announced] we were looking for reinforcements for the team.
And I have two pieces of news for you today: a good one and an even better one.

+++<!-- more -->+++

The good news is that we will have a new pair of hands joining the team soon.
It is still early to share more details, but we are happy to see the new guy with us!

How about the better news?
Well, we can have one more person!
The process has changed a bit since the last time, but everything else holds!
So if you are interested then please apply via the Red Hat https://global-redhat.icims.com/jobs/97420/principal-software-engineer---openshift-connectors/job[job portal].

Don’t be shy, and don’t underestimate yourself. We would rather speak to more people than miss you!
