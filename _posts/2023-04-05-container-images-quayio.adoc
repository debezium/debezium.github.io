As you may have noticed, the Docker company recently announced a reduction of the free organization accounts offering.
The Docker company wanted to provide for free organization accounts only for https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/[Docker-Sponsored Open Source (DSOS)  projects].
Debezium project doesn't meet their definition of open source project as we have a pathway to commercialization.
As the accounts ought to be terminated in 30 days, we immediately started to work on moving out the Debezium project from  Docker Hub.

+++<!-- more -->+++

Based on the feedback from the community, the Docker company later on https://www.docker.com/blog/no-longer-sunsetting-the-free-team-plan/[re-evaluated their decision] and Free Team plan is still available as before.
However, the whole story, and especially the initial intention to give projects which don't meet DSOS conditions only 30 days for migration, undermined our trust in the Docker company and raised a question of what will come in the future.
As a result we decided *not to publish Debezium images on Docker Hub* in the future.

For quite some time we already publish all Debezium images into two container image registries:

* on the https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[Docker Hub]
* on the https://quay.io/organization/debezium/[Quay.io]

Upcomming 2.2 release and previews of 2.3 (including CR releases), will be still available on the Docker Hub, but starting 2.3.0.Final release, we will stop publishing images there.
Images of Debezium 2.3.0.Final and subsequent releases will be available only on the https://quay.io/organization/debezium/[Quay.io].
Older, already published, images will be of course still available through Docker Hub (unless Docker company changes the conditions which would prevent it in the future).
Older Debezium images can be found also on https://quay.io/organization/debezium/[Quay.io].

https://quay.io[Quay.io] is a mature container registry service, which provides additional features like e.g. vulnerability scans.
As the https://quay.io[Quay.io] is run and sponsored by Red Hat, and we already publish the image there, it was a natural choice for us to move to this container registry.

How to migrate to https://quay.io/organization/debezium/[Quay.io]?
It's very simple - just add `quay.io/` prefix to the container image name,
e.g. instead of running 

```
docker pull debezium/connect:latest
```

you run 

```
docker pull quay.io/debezium/connect:latest
```

and similar for any other images or commands.
