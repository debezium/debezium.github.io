I am very happy to share the news that Debezium *1.9.0.Final* has been released!

Key features of this release are support for Apache Cassandra 4, multi-database support for the Debezium connector for SQL Server, the ability to use Debezium Server as a Knative event source, as well as many improvements to the integration of Debezium Server with Redis Streams.

Exactly https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(1.9.0.Alpha1%2C%201.9.0.Alpha2%2C%201.9.0.Beta1%2C%201.9.0.CR1%2C%201.9.0.Final)%20ORDER%20BY%20key%20ASC%2C%20status%20DESC[276 issues] have been fixed by the community for the 1.9 release;
a big thank you to each and everyone who helped to make this happen!

== Support for Apache Cassandra 4

Added right in time for the link:/blog/2022/03/25/debezium-1-9-cr1-released/[candidate release] of Debezium 1.9, support for Cassandra 4 has been added to the link:/documentation/reference/1.9/connectors/cassandra.html[Debezium Cassandra connector].
Or, more specifically, a _new_ connector has been added. I.e. you should now either download the _debezium-connector-cassandra-3_ or the _debezium-connector-cassandra-4_ connector archive,
depending on your database version.
While we usually strive for multi-version support within indvidual connectors,
the code changes required to support the new version were that substantial,
that we decided to have two separate code bases for the two connector versions (with commonalities extracted into a shared module).
Both connectors, for Cassandra 3 and 4, remain in incubating state for the time being and you can expect further improvements to them within the near feature.
A massive thank you to https://github.com/smiklosovic[Štefan Miklošovič] and https://github.com/ahmedjami[Ahmed Eljami] for this huge piece of work, which also paves the road towards moving to Java 11 as the baseline for Debezium in the near future.

== SQL Server Multi-Database Support

SQL Server allows for setting up multiple logical databases on one physical host,
which for instance comes in handy for separating the data of different tenants of a multi-tenant capable application.
Historically,
this required to set up one instance of the Debezium connector for SQL Server per logical database,
which could become a bit cumbersome when dealing with tens or even hundreds of databases.

Over the last year, Sergei Morozov and his team at SugarCRM reworked the SQL Server connector and the Debezium connector framework to be _multi-partition aware_:
the framework is now capable of streaming changes from multiple _source partitions_,
which are split up between _connector tasks_ (in Kafka Connect terminology),
which in turn can be distributed amongst the worker nodes of a Kafka Connect cluster.

In case of the SQL Server connector, a logical database equates to one such source partition,
so that you now can stream for instance 20 databases from one physical SQL Server host,
spread across four source tasks running on five nodes of a Connect cluster.
To use the new multi-partition mode, configure the names of the databases to capture using the new https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html#sqlserver-property-database-names[`database.names`] connector configuration property (rather than using the previously existing `database.dbname`),
and optionally set the value of `tasks.max` to a value larger than 1.
Note that the schema and topic names as well as the structure of connector metrics differs between single and multi-partition mode,
so as to account for the name of the logical database and the id of the source task, respectively.

Multi-partition mode is experimental as of the 1.9 release and is planned to fully replace the legacy single partition mode for the SQL Server connector in a future release,
i.e. also if you'd capture changes from only one single logical database,
you'll be using the multi-partition mode then.
Multi-partition mode will also be rolled out for other connectors where it's possible, e.g. for the connectors for Oracle and IBM Db2.

Thanks a lot to Sergei and team for their excellent collaboration around that feature!

== Further Changes

Let's take a look at some more features new in Debezium 1.9.
First, Debezium Server now includes a sink adaptor for HTTP,
which means it can be used as a "native" event source for Knative Serving,
without the need for sending messages through a message broker like Apache Kafka first.

Then, the friendly folks over at Redis Labs stepped up and contributed several improvements to how Debezium (Server) integrates with Redis Streams: besides several performance improvements,
the database history for connectors like the MySQL one can now be stored in Redis,
also offsets which can be stored there now.
But they didn't stop there: for instance, Debezium Server now supports custom configuration providers,
as already provided in Kafka Connect.

Going forward, the Redis Labs team is planning on further cool improvements to Debezium at large,
such as better retrying logic.
Looking forward to those!

== Coming Up

So what's next after 1.9?
You may think 1.10, but that's not what we'll do,
instead we're planning to release Debezium 2.0 as a new major version later this year!

While we don't strictly adhere to semantic versioning (i.e. a new minor release like 1.9 may require some small degree of consideration),
one of our key objectives with Debezium releases is to limit breaking changes for existing users as much as possible.
That's why for instance superfluous configuration options are not just removed but deprecated.
The same applies for changes to the change event format, which are rolled out gradually.
Over time, this has led to a number of legacy options and other aspects which we finally want to iron out.
Debezium 2.0 will be this release,
where we will get rid of this kind of legacy cruft.
For instance,
we are planning to

* Remove the legacy implementations of the connectors for MySQL and MongoDB
(superseded by more capable and mature implementations based on Debezium's standard connector framework,
which have been enabled by default for quite some time)
* Drop wal2json support for Postgres (superseded by pgoutput)
* Use Java 11 as a baseline (for instance allowing to emit JDK Flight Recorder events for better diagnostics)
* Default to multi-partition mode metrics (more consistent)
* Make default topic names more consistent (for instance for the heartbeat topic)
* Change the default type mappings for a small number of column types

Planning for this is in full swing right now,
and you are very much invited to join the https://groups.google.com/g/debezium/[discussion] either on the mailing list or on the https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3899[DBZ-3899] issue in Jira.
Note that while we want to take the opportunity to clean up some odditities which have accumulated over time,
backwards compatibility will be key concern as always, and we'll try to minimize the impact on existing users as much as possible.
But as you would expect it from a new major release, upgrading may take a slightly larger effort in comparison to the usual minor releases.
In terms of a timeline, due to the size and number of planned changes, we're going to deviate from the usual quarterly release cadence and instead reserve two quarters for working on Debezium 2.0,
i.e. you can look forward to that release at the end of September.
In the meantime, there will be bugfix releases of the 1.9 version, as needed per reported bugs.

Upwards and onwards!
