The Debezium UI team is pleased to announce support for Single Message Transformations (SMTs) in the Debezium UI!  Our goal with the Debezium graphical user interface is to allow users to set up and operate connectors more easily.  To that end, we have added support for Single Message Transformations to the UI.  Read futher for more information, and for a video demo of the new feature!

Let's take a closer look at Debezium UI support for definition of SMTs

== Single Message Transformations (SMTs)

Connectors can be configured with transformations to make lightweight per message modifications. Debezium provides several single message transformations (SMTs) that you can use to either modify records before they are sent to Apache Kafka (by applying them to the Debezium connectors), or when they are read from Kafka by a sink connector.

To learn more about the SMTs coming with Debezium, please refer to the link:/documentation/reference/transformations/index.html[reference documentation]

For a short demo of the SMT feature, see the following video:

== Trying It Out Yourself

We have created a self-contained example https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/main/ui-demo[UI demo], which is included under https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples[debezium-examples] on Github.  The UI demo includes a Docker Compose file which brings up several sources with data as well as the UI. Please refer to the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/main/ui-demo[README file] for more details on running the Debezium UI demo.

To learn more about the Debezium UI, please refer to the link:/documentation/reference/operations/debezium-ui.html[reference documentation].

== Next Steps

We plan to continue with improvements and new features for the UI in the coming releases.  Some items under consideration:

* Incorporation of more Debezium connector types, such as the ones for SQL Server and Oracle
* Addition and improvement of connector metrics and monitoring
* Add capability for viewing and editing connector properties after creation
* ...And more!

We'd also be very happy to learn about your requirements and feedback on the Debezium UI.
