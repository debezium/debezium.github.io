It's with great pleasure that I am announcing the release of Debezium *1.7.0.Final*!

Key features of this release include substantial improvements to the notion of incremental snapshotting (as introduced in Debezium 1.6),
a web-based user Debezium user interface,
NATS support in Debezium Server,
and support for running Apache Kafka without ZooKeeper via the Debezium Kafka container image.

Also in the wider Debezium community some exciting things happened over the last few months;
For instance, we saw a CDC connector for ScyllaDB link:/blog/2021/09/22/deep-dive-into-a-debezium-community-connector-scylla-cdc-source-connector/[based on the Debezium connector framework],
and there's work happening towards a https://github.com/memiiso/debezium-server-iceberg[Debezium Server connector for Apache Iceberg] (details about this coming soon in a guest post on this blog).

== Incremental Snapshotting Improvements

Introduced in Debezium 1.6 and based on a https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12597v1.pdf[paper published by Netflix Engineering],
incremental snapshotting addresses many long-standing feature requests around initial snapshots,
such as the ability to re-snapshot specific tables, support for modifications to the include/exclude filter configuration,
and resumeability of snapshots after a connector restart.

For Debezium 1.7, incremental snapshotting has been further improved and stabilized.
The link:/documentation/reference/connectors/mysql.html[Debezium MySQL connector] now allows incremental snapshotting for databases without write access by the connector,
which is very useful when pointing Debezium to read-only replicas.
Ad-hoc snapshots can now not only be triggered via the signal table as before,
but also by sending a message to a specific Kafka topic, again strengthening the support for read-only scenarios.
A big thank you to https://github.com/kgalieva[Kate Galieva] of https://shopify.engineering/capturing-every-change-shopify-sharded-monolith[Shopify Engineering] for these contributions!

Incremental snapshotting is now also supported by the link:/documentation/reference/connectors/oracle.html[Debezium connector for Oracle].
Another snapshotting improvement relates to non-incremental snapshots:
filtered columns are now excluded from snapshot select statements right away, which improves performance of the connector when excluding large BLOB columns for instance.

We'll follow up with a more detailed blog post around incremental snapshotting shortly.

== Debezium UI

Debezium UI is part of our efforts to further simplify the experience of getting started with and operating Debezium.
link:/documentation/reference/operations/debezium-ui.html[The UI] lets you configure and start new connectors,
examine the state of running connectors, and more.

The Debezium UI team has been working tirelessly to build out this web app,
with support for setting up transformations (SMTs) and topic auto creation settings coming up shortly.
In the meantime please take a look at the link:/blog/2021/08/12/introducing-debezium-ui/[blog post] initially announcing the UI to learn more about it.

== Further Improvements

Other improvements in Debezium 1.7 include link:/documentation/reference/operations/debezium-server.html#_nats_streaming[support for NATS Streaming in Debezium Server], as well as support for Apache Kafka 2.8 in the Debezium container images.
You even can use the Debezium container image for Apache Kafka to https://debezium.io/blog/2021/08/31/going-zookeeperless-with-debezium-container-image-for-apache-kafka/[get your feet wet] with running Apache Kafka without ZooKeeper!

There's support for MySQL `INVISIBLE` columns, an off-heap implementation of the transaction buffer of the Debezium connector for Oracle,
allowing to process large long-running transactions, and much more.
There also have been made several very nice performance improvements;
a shout-out to Naveen Kumar for his continued help here, including the creation of several JMH benchmarks for measuring the impact of improvements to specific performance-sensitive areas of the code base.

Altogether, https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4067?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(1.7.0.Alpha1%2C%201.7.0.Beta1%2C%201.7.0.CR1%2C%201.7.0.CR2%2C%201.7.0.Final[206 issues] have been fixed for the 1.7 final and preview releases.

== Outlook

The next Debezium release, 1.8, is planned for the end of the year.
The link:/roadmap/[roadmap] is still in flux, but some of the features we plan to address are support for MongoDB change streams (so to support MongoDB 5.0),
improved support for MariaDB,
and the ability to compact large database history topics.

We're also planning to further build out the Debezium UI, continue the work on the Debezium connector for Oracle and making the SQL Server connector capable of dealing with multiple databases at once, and much more.
Please let us know about your feature requests via the https://groups.google.com/g/debezium[mailing list]!
