_TL,DR: Debezium is NOT affected by the recently disclossed remote code execution vulnerability in log4j2
(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228[CVE-2021-44228]);
The log4j-1.2.17.jar shipped in Debezium's container images contains a class `JMSAppender`,
which is subject to a MODERATE vulnerability
(https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104[CVE-2021-4104]).
This appender is NOT used by default,
i.e. access to log4j's configuration is required in order to exploit this CVE.
As a measure of caution, we have decided to remove the `JMSAppender` class from Debezium's container images as of version 1.7.2.Final, released today._

On Dec 10th, a remote code execution vulnerability in the widely used log4j2 library was published
(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228[CVE-2021-44228]).
Debezium, just like Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect, does not use log4j2 and therefore is NOT affected by this CVE.

+++<!-- more -->+++

Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect and Apache ZooKeeper do use log4j 1.x though,
which therefore is shipped as part of https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Debezium's container images] for these components.
On Dec 13th, a MODERATE vulnerability in log4j 1.x was published
(https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104[CVE-2021-4104]),
affecting the `JMSAppender` class coming with log4j 1.x.
This vulnerability "allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the deployed application is configured to use `JMSAppender` and to the attacker's JMS Broker".

This appender is NOT used by default,
i.e. "this flaw ONLY affects applications which are specifically configured to use `JMSAppender`, which is not the default, or when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration for adding `JMSAppender` to the attacker's JMS Broker".
If you are using `JMSAppender`, you should verify and ensure that you are using trustworthy configuration values for its `TopicBindingName` and `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName` settings.

Using a JMS-based appender should only very rarely occur in the context of Apache Kafka, if at all.
As a measure of caution, we have therefore decided to remove the `JMSAppender` class from the _log4j-1.2.17.jar_ JAR contained in Debezium's container images for Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Apache ZooKeeper.
At the same time, we are also removing the `SocketServer` class from the _log4j-1.2.17.jar_,
which is subject to another, unrelated CVE (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17571[CVE-2019-17571]).
This is a separate main class, not used in any way by Debezium, Kafka, Kafka Connect, or ZooKeeper,
but we decided to not ship it any longer, thus making the Debezium container images not subject to this CVE either.

Note that if you are running the Debezium connectors via other distributions of Apache Kafka and related components,
the `JMSAppender` and `SocketServer` classes may be present in their _log4j-1.2.17.jar_,
and you thus should make sure to either not use them at all, or only use them in safe way.
Access to log4j's configuration should be secured in an appropriate way.

Other distributables of Debezium, such as the individual connector archives, or the Debezium Server distribution, do not contain _log4j-1.2.17.jar_ and thus are NOT subject to the mentioned CVEs in any way.

The removal of the `JMSAppender` and `SocketServer` classes from the _log4j-1.2.17.jar_ shipped with Debezium's container images is effective as of Debezium 1.7.2.Final,
which was released earlier today.
We recommend to update to this version to all users.

If you have any questions around this topic, please join the discussion on https://groups.google.com/g/debezium/c/W3jYvNc-d5M[this thread] on the Debezium mailling list.
If you have any other security-related concerns around Debezium, please do NOT publicly discuss them, but file a Jira issue with limited visibility in our https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ[bug tracker], and we will follow up with you on this as quickly as possible.
