I'm happy to announce that **Debezium 0.2.2 is now available**. This release fixes several bugs in the MySQL connector that can produce change events with incorrect `source` metadata, and that eliminates the possibility a poorly-timed connector crash causing the connector to only process some of the rows in a multi-row MySQL event. See our link:/docs/releases/#release-0-2-2[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

Also, thanks to a community member for https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[reporting] that Debezium 0.2.x can only be used with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1. Debezium 0.2.x cannot be used with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.0 because of its https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[backward incompatible changes to the consumer API]. Our next release of Debezium will support Kafka 0.10.x.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with label `0.2` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].
