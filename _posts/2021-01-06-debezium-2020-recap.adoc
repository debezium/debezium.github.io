A Happy New Year to the Debezium Community!

May all your endavours be successful, your data be consistent, and most importantly, everyone stay safe and healthy.
With 2020 in the books, I thought it'd be nice to take a look back and do a quick recap of what has happened around Debezium over the last year.

First, some facts and numbers for you stats lovers out there:

+++<!-- more -->+++

* After the release of link:/blog/2019/12/18/debezium-1-0-0-final-released/[Debezium 1.0] in December 2019, we successfully released a stable Debezium version at the end of each quarter, with preview releases roughly every three weeksfootnote:[ Where is Debezium 1.4, you ask? The agile bunch we are, we adhered to the "Individuals over processes" principle and decided to move this release to later this week, due to the holiday break :)]
* About 1,400 commits in the core repo (plus many more in the other ones), 36 blog posts and release announcements, 166 threads on the https://groups.google.com/g/debezium/[mailing list] (if the query in my Google inbox is to be trusted)
* About 100 new contributors, bringing the https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt[overall number] of people contributing to the Debezium core repo to 245, plus additional people contributing to the other repositories of the Debezium GitHub organization
* The first https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/04/14/capture-database-changes-with-debezium-apache-kafka-connectors/[GA release] of the commercially supported Debezium offering by Red Hat, as part of https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration[Red Hat Integration]
* link:/blog/2020/07/28/hello-debezium/[Two] link:/blog/2020/10/27/hello-debezium/[new] members on the core engineering team -- the more, the merrier!
* About 1,600 additional GitHub ⭐s for the Debezium core repo, bringing the total number of star gazers to more than 4,100

While those figures give a nice impression of the overall activity of Debezium, they don't really tell _what_ has been happening exactly.
What's behind the numbers?
Here are some of my personal Debezium highlights from the last year:

* Two new, community-led Debezium connectors for https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-db2/[Db2] and https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-vitess/[Vitess];
a big shout-out to the engineers of link:/blog/2020/03/05/db2-cdc-approaches/[IBM] and link:/blog/2020/11/04/streaming-vitess-at-bolt/[Bolt], respectively, for stepping up and taking the lead of these connectors!
* Besides these new connectors, each of the releases brought a wide range of new features; some of the things I'm most excited about are link:/documentation/reference/1.2/operations/debezium-server.html[Debezium Server] for integrating Debezium with message infrastructure like Apache Pulsar, AWS Kinesis, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and Azure Event Hubs, the link:/documentation/reference/1.1/integrations/outbox.html[Quarkus extension] for implementing the outbox pattern, 
the new link:/documentation/reference/connectors/oracle.html#_logminer[LogMiner-based connector implementation] for ingesting change events from Oracle,
transaction markers, support for CloudEvents, and so much more!
* Integration of Debezium by multiple open-source projects, 
e.g. https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/table/connectors/formats/debezium.html[Apache Flink],
https://spring.io/blog/2020/12/14/case-study-change-data-capture-cdc-analysis-with-cdc-debezium-source-and-analytics-sink-in-real-time[Spring Cloud Stream],
https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/cdc[Hazecast Jet], and 
https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/05/CdcWithCamelAndDebezium/[Apache Camel].
Further integrators of Debezium include https://materialize.io/docs/third-party/debezium/[Materialize], https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-to-move-data-from-mysql-to-bigquery[Google Cloud DataFlow] and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-data-connectors[Heroku’s streaming data connectors].
Here on this blog, we also discussed how to integrate and use Debezium with technologies such as link:/blog/2020/03/19/integration-testing-for-change-data-capture-with-testcontainers/[Testcontainers],
the link:/blog/2020/04/09/using-debezium-with-apicurio-api-schema-registry/[Apicurio API and schema registry],
and link:/blog/2020/12/16/distributed-tracing-with-debezium/[OpenTracing].
* Debezium being https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/debezium[listed at "Trial" level] on the ThoughtWorks Tech Radar
* A proof-of-concept for a link:/blog/2020/10/22/towards-debezium-ui/[graphical user interface for configuring and operating Debezium];
stay tuned for more details here, as this is currently in the process of being built out for other connectors

The year also brought a large number of blog posts and presentations from the community about their experiences with Debezium.

It is just so amazing to see how engaged and helpful this community is; A big thank you to everyone for writing and talking about your experiences with Debezium and change data capture!

I think 2020 has been a great year for the Debezium community,
and I couldn't be happier about all the things we've achieved together.
Again, a huge thank you to each and everyone in the community contributing to the project,
be it via by implementing features and bug fixes, reporting issues, engaging in discussions, answering questions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/debezium[Stack Overflow], helping to spread the word in blog posts and conference talks, or otherwise!

What's on the roadmap for this year?
It's fair to say: "A lot" :) E.g. we'd like to rework the way snapshots are done: they should be parallelizeable, updates to the include/exclude filters should be possible, and more.
The Debezium UI will see substantial expansion and improvements. We're planning to conduct a systematic performance profiling and improvements of identified bottlenecks. There may be official support for MariaDB, as well as an operator for running Debezium Server on Kubernetes.
Plus some super-cool things I cannot talk about at this point yet :)

Onwards and Upwards!
