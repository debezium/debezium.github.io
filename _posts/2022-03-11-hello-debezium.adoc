Hi everyone, my name is Vojtěch Juránek and I recently joined the Debezium team.

Most of my professional IT career I've spent at Red Hat. 
I have a background in particle physics, but I did quite a lot programming even before joining Red Hat, when working on https://herwig.hepforge.org/[simulations of high-energy particle collisions] and their https://root.cern/[data analysis].
The science is by default open and all software I was using was open source as well.
Here started my love for open source.

+++<!-- more -->+++

When I decided to do programming for a living, Red Had was a natural choice for me, as by that time it was one of the few companies which promoted open source heavily.
I started to work at Red Hat as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_(software)[Hudson] developer.
I developed and maintained many plugins and also contributed to Hudson core.
I focused mainly on Hudson stability and memory footprint as I also took care about internal JBoss Hudson instance, which was the world's largest Hudson deployment by that time.
When Hudson was forked to https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins], I co-created and a maintained Jenkins LTS (long term support) branch.
I was also a member of Jenkins CERT team.

After a couple of years spent with Hudson/Jenkins, I decided it's time to move on and joined https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan] team as a quality engineer.
Knowing only a little about things like memory data grid when I joined the team, I quickly discovered the beautiful world of distributed systems and fell in love with it.
As a quality engineer on the Infinispan project I not only dug deep in distributed databases and consensus algorithms, but also became familiar with other very interesting projects like e.g. https://jepsen.io/[Jepsen].

Later on, I accepted the challenge to discover another interesting world - the world of virtual machines and data centers and started to work as a developer on https://www.ovirt.org/[oVirt project] project in the storage team.
I was mostly working on low level stuff, on projects https://github.com/ovirt/vdsm[vdsm] and https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-imageio/[imageio].

Working on oVirt was interesting, but I was really excited when I got an opportunity to move back to databases and distributed systems and join the Debezium project.
I'm looking forward to work on this wonderful project!

Onwards,

--Vojta
