Let me announce the bugfix release of Debezium 1.5, *1.5.2.Final*!

This release is a rebuild of 1.5.1.Final using Java 8.

+++<!-- more -->+++

Debezium 1.5.1.Final was incorrectly built using Java 11.
That would prevent it running in environments still using Java 8.
This version is rebuilt using Java 8.

Overall, https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20and%20fixVersion%20%3D%201.5.2.Final[2 issues] were fixed for this release.
Thanks a lot to all contributors!
