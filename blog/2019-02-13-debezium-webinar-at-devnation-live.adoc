Last week I had the pleasure to do a https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/QYbXDp4Vu-8/[webinar on change data streaming patterns for microservices] with the fabulous Burr Sutter at DevNation Live.

The recording of that 30 min session is available on YouTube now.
It also contains a demo that shows how to set-up a data streaming pipeline with Debezium and Apache Kafka,
running on OpenShift.
The demo begins at 12 min 40 into the recording.

Enjoy!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
