We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.4** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains several new features for the MySQL connector: support for MySQL's link:/docs/connectors/mysql/#data-types[`JSON`] datatype, a new snapshot mode called link:/docs/connectors/mysql/#snapshots[`schema_only`], and link:/docs/monitoring[JMX metrics]. Also, the Debezium Docker images for Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect have all been updated to allow optionally link:/docs/monitoring[expose JMX metrics] in these services. And, one backward-incompatible fix was made to the change event's `ts_sec` field. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Akshath, Chris, Vitalii, Dennis, Prannoy, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
