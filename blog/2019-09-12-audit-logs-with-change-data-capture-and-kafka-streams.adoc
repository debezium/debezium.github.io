:awestruct-layout: blog-post

It is a common requirement for business applications to maintain some form of audit log,
i.e. a persistent trail of all the changes to the application's data.
If you squint a bit, a Kafka topic with Debezium data change events is quite similar to that:
sourced from database transaction logs, it describes all the changes to the records of an application.
What's missing though is some metadata: why, when and by whom was the data changed?
In this post we're going to explore how that metadata can be provided and exposed via change data capture (CDC), and how stream processing can be used to enrich the actual data change events with such metadata.

Reasons for maintaining data audit trails are manifold:
e.g. regulatory requirements may mandate businesses to keep complete historic information of their customer, purchase order, invoice or other data.
Also for an enterprise's own purposes it can be very useful to be able to analyze why and how certain data has changed, e.g. allowing to improve business processes and analyze errors.

Traditionally, application-side libraries and database triggers have been common means for creating audit trails:
when a data record is inserted, updated or deleted, they'd maintain specific column(s) in the data tables ("createdBy", "lastUpdated" etc.) and/or copy earlier record versions into some form of history tables.
This comes with some disadvantages, though:

* metadata columns and triggers add bloat to the model in the database and the corresponding application domain model
* writing records in history tables as part of OLTP transactions increases the number of executed statements within the transaction and thus may cause longer response times of the application

Library-based solutions also oftentimes cannot provide metadata in case of bulk UPDATEs and DELETEs,
as the listeners used to hook them into the persistence framework are not aware of all the affected records.
Also, by definition, any approach based on an application-side library is prone to miss any data changes done directly in the database, e.g. when running a data load or bypassing the application during an emergency data patch.

These problems don't exist when leveraging the transaction log as the source for an audit trail and using change data capture for retrieving the change information and sending it into a message broker or log such as Apache Kafka.
Running asynchronously, the CDC process can extract the change data without impacting OLTP transactions, not missing any event, no matter whether what its origin is and whether it was caused by a bulk operation.

How can CDC access the aforementioned metadata, though?
This could for instance be data such as the application user that performed a data change,
their IP address and device configuration, a tracing span id, or an identifier for the application use case.

As that metadata typically isn't (nor shouldn't) be stored in the actual business tables of an application, it must be provided separately.
One approach is to have a separate table where this metadata is stored.
For each executed transaction, the business application produces one record in that table, containing all the required metadata and using the transaction id as a primary key.
When running manual data changes, it is easy to also provide the metadata record with an additional insert.
As Debezium's data change events contain the id of the transaction causing the specific change,
the data change events and the metadata records can be correlated.

In the remainder of this post we're going to take a closer look at how a business application can provide the transaction-scoped metadata and how data change events can be enriched with that metadata using the Kafka Streams API.

== Solution Overview

The following image shows the overall solution design, based on the example of a microservice for managing vegetable data:

</div>
++++

The architecture is made up of these components:

* _vegetables-service_: a simple REST service for inserting and updating vegetable data into a Postgres database;
as part of its processing, it will not only update its actual "business table" `vegetable`,
but also insert some auditing metadata into a dedicated metadata table `transaction_context_data`;
Debezium is used to stream change events from the two tables into corresponding topics in Apache Kafka
* _log-enricher_: a stream processing based on Kafka Streams,
which enriches the messages from the CDC topic containing the `vegetable` change events (`dbserver1.inventory.vegetable`) with the corresponding metadata in the `dbserver1.inventory.transaction_context_data` topic sourced from the `transaction_context_data` table and writes the enriched vegetable change event back to Kafka into the `dbserver1.inventory.vegetable.enriched` topic.

You can find a https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/auditlog[complete example] with all the components on GitHub.

== Providing Auditing Metadata

Let's first discuss how an application such as the vegetable service can provide the required auditing metadata.
As an example, the following metadata should be made available for auditing purposes:

* The application user that did a data change, as represented by the `sub` claim of a JWT token (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Token])
* The request timestamp, as represented by the `Date` HTTP header
* A use case identifier, as provided via a custom Java annotation on the invoked REST resource method

Here is a basic implementation of a REST resource for persisting a new vegetable using the JAX-RS API:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/vegetables")
@RequestScoped
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class VegetableResource {

    @Inject
    VegetableService vegetableService;

    @POST
    @RolesAllowed({"farmers"})
    @Transactional
    @Audited(useCase="CREATE VEGETABLE")
    public Response createVegetable(Vegetable vegetable) {
        if (vegetable.getId() != null) {
            return Response.status(Status.BAD_REQUEST.getStatusCode()).build();
        }

        vegetable = vegetableService.createVegetable(vegetable);

        return Response.ok(vegetable).status(Status.CREATED).build();
    }

    // update, delete ...
}
----

Not too exciting, if you've ever built REST services with JAX-RS before:
a resource method annotated with `@POST` takes the incoming request payload and passes it to a service bean which is injected via CDI.
The `@Audited` annotation is special, though.
It is a custom annotation which serves two purposes:

* Specifying the use case that should be referenced in the audit log ("CREATE VEGETABLE")
* Binding an interceptor which will be triggered for each invocation of a method annotated with `@Audited`

That interceptor implements the logic for writing the transaction-scoped audit metadata and is defined like this:

[source,java]
----
@Interceptor
@Priority(value = Interceptor.Priority.APPLICATION + 100)
@Audited(useCase = "")
public class TransactionInterceptor {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken jwt;

    @Inject
    EntityManager entityManager;

    @Inject
    HttpServletRequest request;

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object manageTransaction(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception {
        BigInteger txtId = (BigInteger) entityManager.createNativeQuery("SELECT txid_current()").getSingleResult();
        String useCase = ctx.getMethod().getAnnotation(Audited.class).useCase();

        TransactionContextData context = new TransactionContextData();

        context.transactionId = txtId.longValueExact();
        context.userName = jwt.<String>claim("sub").orElse("anonymous");
        context.clientDate = getRequestDate();
        context.useCase = useCase;

        entityManager.persist(context);

        return ctx.proceed();
    }

    private ZonedDateTime getRequestDate() {
        String requestDate = request.getHeader(HttpHeaders.DATE);
        return requestDate != null ? ZonedDateTime.parse(requestDate, DateTimeFormatter.RFC_1123_DATE_TIME) : null;
    }
}
----

`@Interceptor` and `@Audited` mark this as an interceptor bound to our custom `@Audited` annotion.
The `@Priority` annotation controls at which point in the interceptor stack the auditing interceptor should be invoked.
Any application-provided interceptors should have a priority larger than `Priority.APPLICATION` (2000);
in particular, this ensures that a transaction will have been started before by means of the `@Transactional` annotation and its accompanying interceptor which run in the `Priority.PLATFORM_BEFORE` range (0).

Whenever a method annotated with `@Audited` is invoked, the interceptor will kick in and

* obtain the current transaction id (the exact way for doing so is database-specific, in the example the `txid_current()` function from Postgres can be called)
* persist a `TransactionContextData` record via JPA, whose primary key value is the transaction id, and which has attributes for the user name (obtained from the injected JWT token), the request date (obtained from the `DATE` HTTP request header) and the use case identifier (obtained from the `@Audited` annotation of the invoked method)
* continue the call flow of the invoked method

When invoking the REST service to create and update a few vegetables,
the following records should be created in the database
(refer to the README in the provided example for instructions on building the example code and https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/auditlog#inserting-some-data-and-observing-the-audit-log[invoking the vegetable service] with a suitable JWT token):

== Enriching Change Events with Auditing Metadata

With the business data (vegetables) and the transaction-scoped metadata being stored in the database,
it's time to set up the link:/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/postgresql.html[Debezium Postgres connector] and stream the data changes from the `vegetable` and `transaction_context_data` tables into corresponding Kafka topics.
Again refer to the example README file for the details of https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/auditlog#deploy-the-debezium-postgres-connector[deploying the connector].

The `dbserver1.inventory.vegetable` topic should contain contain change events for created, updated and deleted vegetable records, whereas the `dbserver1.inventory.transaction_context_data` topic should only contain create messages for each inserted metadata record.

Now, if we look at messages from the two topics, we can see that they can be correlated based on the transaction id:

++++
<div class="imageblock centered-image">
    <img src="/images/auditing_input_messages.png" style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;" class="responsive-image" alt="Vegetable and Transaction Metadata Messages">
</div>
++++

The transaction id is part of the `source` structure of vegetable change events,
and it is the message key of metadata events.
Once we've found the corresponding transaction event for a given data change event,
the `client_date`, `usecase` and `user_name` attributes from the former can be added to the latter:

++++
<div class="imageblock centered-image">
    <img src="/images/auditing_output_message.png" style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;" class="responsive-image" alt="Enriched Vegetable Message">
</div>
++++

This kind of message transformation is a perfect use case for https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/[Kafka Streams],
a Java API for implementing stream processing applications on top of on Kafka topics,
providing operators that let you filter, transform, aggregate and join Kafka messages.

As foundation for our stream processing application we're going to use https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus],
which is "a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards".

.Building Kafka Streams with Quarkus
[NOTE]
===============================
Amongst many others, Quarkus comes with an https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide[extension for Kafka Streams],
which allows to build stream processing applications running on the JVM and as native code compiled ahead-of-time.
It takes care of the lifecycle of the streaming topology,
so you don't have to deal with details like registering JVM shutdown hooks,
awaiting the creation of all input topics and more.
The extension also comes with "live development" support,
which automatically reloads the stream processing application while you're working on it,
allowing for very fast turnaround cycles during development.
===============================

=== Joining Logic

When thinking about the actual implementation of the enrichment logic,
a https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#kstream-kstream-join[stream-to-stream] join might appear as a suitable solution.
By creating ``KStream``s for the two topics, we may try and implement the joining functionality.
This creates a problem though in regards to ordering guarantees of the change events.
By default, Debezium will use a table's primary key as the message key for the corresponding Kafka messages.
This means that all messages for the same vegetable record will have the same key and thus will go into the same partition of the vegetables Kafka topic.
This in turn guarantees that a consumer of these events sees all the messages pertaining to the same vegetable record in the exact same order as they were created.

Now, in order to join the two streams, the message key must be the same on both sides.
This means the vegetables topic must be re-keyed by transaction id
(we cannot re-key the transaction metadata topic, as there's no information about concerned vegetables contained in the metadata events; and even if that were the case, one transaction might impact multiple vegetable records).
By doing so, we'd loose the original ordering guarantees, though.
One vegetable record might be modified in two subsequent transactions,
and its change events may end up in different partitions of the re-keyed topic,
which may cause a consumer to receive the second change event before the first one.

If a `KStream`-`KStream` join isn't feasible, what else could be done?
A `KStream`-`GlobalKTable` join looks promising, too.
It doesn't have the co-partitioning requirements of stream-to-stream joins,
as all partitions of the `GlobalKTable` are present on all nodes of a distributed Kafka Streams application.
So we could have a `KStream` sourced from the vegetables topic and a `GlobalKTable` based on the transaction metadata topic.
Unfortunately, there is a timing issue:
as the messages are consumed from multiple topics, it may happen that at the point in time when an element from the vegetables stream is processed, the corresponding transaction metadata message isn't available yet.
So depending on whether we'd be using an inner join or a left join,
we'd in this case either skip change events or propagate them without having enriched them with the transaction metadata.
Both outcomes are not desirable.

=== Customized Joins With Buffering

The combination of `KStream` and `GlobalKTable` still hints into the right direction.
Instead of relying on the built-in join operators we'll have to implement a custom joining logic, though.
The basic idea is to buffer messages arriving on the vegetable `KStream` until the corresponding metadata message is available from the ``GlobalKTable``s state store.
This can be achieved by creating a custom `Transformer` which implements the required buffering logic and is applied to the vegetable `KStream`.

Let's begin with the streaming topology itself.
Thanks to the Quarkus Kafka Streams extension,
a CDI producer method returning the `Topology` object is all that's needed for that:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class TopologyProducer {

    static final String STREAM_BUFFER_NAME = "stream-buffer-state-store";
    static final String STORE_NAME = "transaction-meta-data";

    @ConfigProperty(name = "audit.context.data.topic")
    String txContextDataTopic;

    @ConfigProperty(name = "audit.vegetables.topic")
    String vegetablesTopic;

    @ConfigProperty(name = "audit.vegetables.enriched.topic")
    String vegetablesEnrichedTopic;

    @Produces
    public Topology buildTopology() {
        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        StoreBuilder<KeyValueStore<Long, JsonObject>> streamBufferStateStore =
                Stores
                    .keyValueStoreBuilder(
                        Stores.persistentKeyValueStore(STREAM_BUFFER_NAME),
                        new Serdes.LongSerde(),
                        new JsonObjectSerde()
                    )
                    .withCachingDisabled();
            builder.addStateStore(streamBufferStateStore);

        builder.globalTable(txContextDataTopic, Materialized.as(STORE_NAME));

        builder.<JsonObject, JsonObject>stream(vegetablesTopic)
                .filter((id, changeEvent) -> changeEvent != null)
                .filter((id, changeEvent) -> !changeEvent.getString("op").equals("r"))
                .transform(() -> new ChangeEventEnricher(), STREAM_BUFFER_NAME)
                .to(vegetablesEnrichedTopic);

        return builder.build();
    }
}
----

The `StreamsBuilder` from Kafka Streams is used here to

* set up a state store which will serve as the buffer for change events that cannot be processed yet
* define a `GlobalKTable` based on the transaction metadata topic and
* define a `KStream` based on the vegetables topic; on this stream, any incoming tombstone markers are filtered, the reasoning being that the retention policy for an audit trail topic typically should be time-based than based on log compaction; similarly, snapshot events are filtered, assuming they are not relevant for an audit trail and there wouldn't be any corresponding metadata provided by the application for the snapshot transaction initiated by the Debezium connector; any other messages are enriched with the corresponding transaction metadata via a custom `Transformer` (see below) and finally are written to an output topic

.Topic Retention
[NOTE]
===============================
In order to manage the growth of involved topics, the retention policy for each topic should be well-defined.
For instance for the actual audit log topic with the enriched change events, a time based retention policy might be suitable, keeping each log event for as long as needed as per your requirements.
The transaction metadata topic on the other hand can be fairly short-lived, as its entries are not needed any longer, once all corresponding data change events have been processed.
It may be a good idea to set up some monitoring of the end-to-end lag in order to make sure the log enricher stream application keeps up with the incoming messages and doesn't fall behind that far so it is at risk of transaction messages being discarded before processing the corresponding change events.
===============================

The topic names are injected using the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config API], with the values being provided in Quarkus _application.properties_ configuration file.
Besides the topic names, this file also has the information about the Kafka bootstrap server, default serdes any more:

----

In the next step let's take a look at the `ChangeEventEnricher` class, our custom transformer.
The implemention is based on the assumption that change events are serialized as JSON,
but of course it could be done equally well using other formats such as Avro or Protocol Buffers.

This is a bit of code, but hopefully its decomposition into multiple smaller methods makes it comprehensible:

[source,java]

class ChangeEventEnricher implements Transformer<JsonObject, JsonObject, KeyValue<JsonObject, JsonObject>> {

    private static final Long BUFFER_OFFSETS_KEY = -1L;

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ChangeEventEnricher.class);

----

The basic logic of the transformer is this:

* When a vegetables change event arrives, look up the corresponding metadata in the statestore of the 
transaction topic's `GlobalKTable`, using the transaction id from the `source` block of the change event as the key
* If the metadata could be found, add the metadata to change event (under the `audit` field) and return that enriched event
* If the metadata could not be found, add the incoming event into the buffer of change events and return
* Before actually getting to the incoming event, all buffered events are processed; only if all could be enriched, the incoming event will be processed, too
* In order to emit buffered events also if no new change event is coming in, the `punctuate()` method is used to periodically process the buffer

The key piece is the buffer for unprocesseable change events.
To maintain the order of events, the buffered must be processed in order of insertion,
beginning with the event inserted first.
As there's guaranteed traversing order when getting all the entries from a `KeyValueStore`,
this is implemented by using the values of a strictly increasing sequence as the keys.
A https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/blob/master/auditlog/log-enricher/src/main/java/io/debezium/demos/auditing/enricher/BufferOffsets.java[special entry] in the key value store is used to store the information about the current "oldest" index in the buffer and the next sequence value.

One could also think of alternative implementations for such buffer, e.g. based on a Kafka topic or a custom `KeyValueStore` implementation that ensures iteration order from oldest to newest entry.
Ultimately, it could also be useful if Kafka Streams came with built-in means of retrying a stream element that cannot be joined yet; this would avoid any custom buffering implementation.

With the custom transformer logic in place, we can build the Quarkus project and run the stream processing application.
You should see messages like this in the `dbserver1.inventory.vegetable.enriched` topic:

    }
}

Of course, the buffer processing logic may be adjusted as per your specific requirements;
for instance instead of indefinitely waiting for corresponding transaction metadata,
we may also decide that it makes more sense to propagate change events unenriched after some waiting time or to raise an exception indicating the missing metadata.

Queries: materialize to table again

Don't have to enrich could also leave for read

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
