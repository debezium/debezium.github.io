It's my pleasure to announce the release of Debezium *0.9.4.Final*!

This is a drop-in replacement for earlier Debezium 0.9.x versions, containing mostly bug fixes and some improvements related to metrics.
Overall, https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.9.4.Final[17 issues] were resolved.

== MySQL Connector Improvements

The Debezium connector for MySQL comes with two new metrics:

* Whether GTID is enabled for offset tracking or not (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1221[DBZ-1221])
* Number of filtered events (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1206[DBZ-1206])

It also supports database connections using TLS 1.2 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1208[DBZ-1208]) now.

== New Postgres Datatypes

The Postgres connector now allows to capture changes to columns of the `CIDR` and `INET` types (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1189[DBZ-1189]).

== Bug Fixes

The fixed bugs include the following:

* Closing connection after snapshotting (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1218[DBZ-1218])
* Can parse ALTER statement affecting enum column with character set options (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1203[DBZ-1203])
* Avoiding timeout after bootstrapping a new table (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1207[DBZ-1207])

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
