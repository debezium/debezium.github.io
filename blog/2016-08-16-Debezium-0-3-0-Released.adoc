:awestruct-tags: [ releases, mysql, mongodb, docker ]
:awestruct-layout: blog-post

After a few weeks delay, **Debezium 0.3.0 is now available** for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains an updated link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector] with quite a few bug fixes, and a new *_link:/docs/connectors/mongodb/[MongoDB connector]_* that captures the changes made to a MongoDB replica set or MongoDB sharded cluster. See the link:/docs/connectors/[documentation] for details about how to configure these connectors and how they work.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with labels `0.3` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Andrew, Bhupinder, Chris, David, Horia, Konstantin, Tony, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
