I'm happy to announce that **Debezium 0.2.2 is now available**. This release fixes several bugs in the MySQL connector that can produce change events with incorrect `source` metadata, and that eliminates the possibility a poorly-timed connector crash causing the connector to only process some of the rows in a multi-row MySQL event. See our link:/docs/releases#release-0-2-2[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

Also, thanks to a community member for https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[reporting] that Debezium 0.2.x can only be used with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1. Debezium 0.2.x cannot be used with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.0 because of its https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[backward incompatible changes to the consumer API]. Our next release of Debezium will support Kafka 0.10.x.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with label `0.2` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial[tutorial].

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
