Quickly following up to last week's release of Debezium 0.9, it's my pleasure today to announce the release of Debezium *0.9.1.Final*!

This release fixes a couple of bugs which were reported after the 0.9 release.
Most importantly, there are two fixes to the new link:/docs/connectors/sqlserver/[Debezium connector for SQL Server],
which deal with correct handling of LSNs after connector restarts (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1128[DBZ-1128], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1131[DBZ-1131]).
The connector also uses more reasonable defaults for the `selectMethod` and `fetchSize` options of the SQL Server JDBC driver (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1065[DBZ-1065]),
which can help to significantly increase through-put and reduce memory consumption of the connector.

The MySQL connector supports `GENERATED` columns now with the new Antlr-based DDL parser (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1123[DBZ-1123]),
and for the Postgres connector the handling of primary key column definition changes was improved (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-997[DBZ-997]).

In terms of new features, there is a new container image provided on Docker Hub now:
the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/tooling[debezium/tooling] image contains a couple of open-source CLI tools
(currently https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat], https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie[httpie], https://github.com/stedolan/jq[jq], https://github.com/dbcli/mycli[mycli] and https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli[pqcli])
which greatly help when working with Debezium connectors, Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect on the command line
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1125[DBZ-1125]).
A big thank you to the respective authors these fantastic tools!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
