Did you know December 12th is National Ding-a-Ling Day?
It's the day to call old friends you haven't heard from in a while.
So we thought we'd get in touch with our friends, i.e. you, and share the news about the release of Debezium *1.0.0.CR1*!

It's the first, and ideally only, candidate release, so Debezium 1.0 should be out very soon.
Quite a few nice features found their way into CR1:

* A SerDe (serializer/deserializer) for link:/documentation/reference/1.0/configuration/serdes.html[working with JSON-formatted change data events] in Kafka Streams (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1533[DBZ-1533])
* Advanced type support for Postgres: the long awaited enum types (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-920[DBZ-920]), domain types (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1413[DBZ-1413]) and arrays of UUIDs (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1637[DBZ-1637])
* Graceful handling of MongoDB 4.0 transaction events (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1215[DBZ-1215])
* Full support for Java 11, including the upgrade to Java 11 in the Debezium container images for Apache Kafka and Connect (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-969[DBZ-969], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1402[DBZ-1402]

There was a number of bug fixes, too:

* Graceful handling of an empty history topic for the MySQL connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1201[DBZ-1201])
* Correct column filtering for SQL Server connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1617[DBZ-1617])
* Support for `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME ...` in MySQL (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1645[DBZ-1645])

As were're approaching the 1.0 Final release, we also took the time to check the configuration options of the different connectors for consistency.
Things were in pretty good shape already due to previous work towards unification in Debezium 0.10.
Only for the SQL Server and Oracle connectors, the snapshot mode "initial_schema_only" has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use "schema_only" instead
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-585[DBZ-585]).

Overall, this release contains link:/releases/1.0/release-notes/#release-1.0.0-cr1[24 changes].
As always, this release wouldn't have been possible without the help from folks of the community:
https://github.com/pan3793[Cheng Pan],
https://github.com/collinvandyck[Collin Van Dyck],
https://github.com/gnaazr95[Gurnaaz Randhawa],
https://github.com/grzegorz8[Grzegorz Ko≈Çakowski],
https://github.com/ivansjg[Ivan San Jose],
https://github.com/theodesp[Theofanis Despoudis] and.
https://github.com/deblockt[Thomas Deblock]

Thanks a lot to you! In total, not less than 144 people have contributed to the Debezium main code repository at this point.
Perhaps we can bump this number to 200 in 2020?

Barring any unforeseen issues, this candidate release should be the only one for Debezium 1.0,
and the final version should be in your hands before Christmas.
So please give the CR a try and let us know how it works for you!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
