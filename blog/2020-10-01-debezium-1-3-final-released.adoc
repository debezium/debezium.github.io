Overall, more than 220 individuals have contributed to the Debezium project at this point.

But not only that, also the number of Debezium users is constantly growing,
as e.g. documented on our link:/community/users/[reference list of Debezium users]
(let us know if you want to be added).
There's also several new entries in our compilation of link:/documentation/online-resources/[public talks and blog posts] touching on Debezium,
e.g. a highly recommendable talk by Marta Paes about link:https://noti.st/morsapaes/liQzgs/change-data-capture-with-flink-sql-and-debezium[change data capture with Flink SQL and Debezium],
a blog post by Cemal Turkoglu about https://turkogluc.com/postgresql-capture-data-change-with-debezium/[[making sense of change data capture pipelines for Postgres with the Debezium Kafka Connector],
and a nice piece on https://medium.com/@changeant/implementing-the-transactional-outbox-pattern-with-debezium-in-quarkus-f2680306951[implementing the outbox pattern with Debezium in Quarkus] by Iain Porter.
Abdellatif Bouchama did an amazing job by creating a https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/debezium-openshift-cheat-sheet[cheat sheet] for running Debezium on OpenShift.

== Outlook

With the 1.3 Final release out, planning for the 1.4 version (due by the end of the year) is happening right now.
The link:/roadmap/[roadmap] still is in flux, so make sure to chime in and let us know about your requirements and feature requests.
Some of the things we're likely going to work on include:

* The https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-vitess/[community-led connector] for https://vitess.io/[Vitess]; the initial contribution has already been merged and we plan to ship the first release of this as part of Debezium 1.4 Alpha1 later this month
* Moving the MySQL connector to the CDC connector framework shared by most other Debezium connectors; this will drastically reduce maintenance burden of this connector in the future
* Exploring more powerful snapshotting options (e.g. for parallelization and re-doing snapshots of selected tables)
* Improving the new LogMiner-based implementation for Oracle

And lastly, there's one other area of activity which I'm particularly excited to share here today for the first time:
a proof-of-concept of how a potential future Debezium user interface might look like.
In that PoC we're exploring how a graphical UI could help with the set-up and operation of Debezium connectors.
We've got quite a few ideas in that field and will share more details in a blog post very soon.
If you feel adventureous in the meantime, you could grab the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-ui-poc/[current PoC code] and take it for spin!

Until then, happy change data streaming, onwards and upwards!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
