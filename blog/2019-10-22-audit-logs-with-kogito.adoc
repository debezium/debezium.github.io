As a follow up to the recent link:/blog/2019/10/01/audit-logs-with-change-data-capture-and-stream-processing/[Building Audit Logs with Change Data Capture and Stream Processing] blog post,
we’d like to extend the example with admin features to make it possible to capture and fix any missing transactional data.

In the above mentioned blog post, there is a log enricher service used to combine data inserted or updated in the Vegetable database table with transaction context data such as

* Transaction id
* User name who performed the work
* Use case that was behind the actual change e.g. "CREATE VEGETABLE"

This all works well as long as all the changes are done via the vegetable service. But is this always the case?

What about maintenance activities or migration scripts executed directly on the database level?
There are still a lot of such activities going on, either on purpose or because that is our old habits we are trying to change…


== Maintenance on database level

So let’s assume there is a need to do some maintenance on the inventory database that will essentially make changes to the data stored in the vegetable table. To make it simple, let's just add a new entry into the vegetable table:

[source,sql]
----
insert into inventory.vegetable (id, name, description) values (106, ‘cucumber, 'excellent');
----

Once that is added you will see that the log enricher service is starting to print out quite a few log messages… and it does it constantly.

[source, plain]

Looking at the logs you can identify that it actually refers to the entry we just inserted (id 106).
In addition to that, it refers to missing transaction context data that it cannot find. That is the
consequence of doing it manually on database level instead of going through the  vegetable service.
There is no corresponding data in the `dbserver1.inventory.transaction_context_data` Kafka topic and thus the log enricher cannot
correlate and by that merge/enrich them.

== Kogito to the rescue

There would be a really good feature (or a neat feature as Gunnar said) if we could have some sort of admin service that
 could help in resolving this kind of problems. Mainly because if such entry is added it will block the entire
 enrichment activity as the first missing message will hold off all others.

And here comes https://kogito.kie.org[Kogito] - a cloud native business automation toolkit to build intelligent
business applications based on battle tested capabilities. In other words, it brings business processes and rules
to solve particular business problems. In this case the business problem is blocked log enrichment which can lead to
some lost opportunities (of various types).

What Kogito helps us with is to define our logic to understand what might get wrong, what needs to be done to resolve
it and what are the conditions that can lead to both problem and resolution.


In this particular case we use both processes and rules to make sure we get the context right and react to the events
behind the vegetable service. To be able to spot the erroneous situations we need to monitor two topics:

* `dbserver1.inventory.vegetable` - vegetable data change events
* `dbserver1.inventory.transaction_context_data` - events from vegetable service with additional context data

So for that we define two business processes where each will be started based on incoming messages - from individual
Kafka topics:

</div>
++++

As illustrated above, both processes are initiated based on an incoming message. Then the logic afterwards is significantly different.

The "Transaction context data" process is responsible for just retrieving the event and pushing it into processing phase - that
 essentially means to insert it into the so called "working memory" that is used for rule evaluation. And at that moment it’s done.

The "Vegetable event" process starts in a similar way… it retrieves the message and then (first ignore snapshot messages
in the same way as the log enricher service) will wait for a predefined amount of time (2 seconds) before matching
vegetable and transaction context events. Once there is a match it will simple finish its execution. But if there is
no match found it will create a user task (that’s a task that requires human actors to provide data before process
can move forward).

This is done via admin user interface (http://localhost:8085/[http://localhost:8085/]) that allows to easily spot such instance and
work on them to fix missing data.

</div>
++++

Once the `Use case` and `User name` attributes are provided, the process will create a new transaction context event,
push it to the Kafka topic and complete itself.

After the missing transaction context data event has been put on the topic the log enricher will resume its operation
and you will be able to see the following lines in the log:

[source, plain]
----
log-enricher_1        | 2019-10-11 10:31:00,385 INFO  [io.deb.dem.aud.enr.ChangeEventEnricher] (auditlog-enricher-c9e5d1bb-d953-42b4-8dc6-bbc328f5344f-StreamThread-1) Processing buffered change event for key {"id":106}
log-enricher_1        | 2019-10-11 10:31:00,389 INFO  [io.deb.dem.aud.enr.ChangeEventEnricher] (auditlog-enricher-c9e5d1bb-d953-42b4-8dc6-bbc328f5344f-StreamThread-1) Enriched change event for key {"id":106}
----

With this you can easily administrate the audit logs to make sure any erroneous situations are resolved quickly
to not affect any other activities.
