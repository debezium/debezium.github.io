We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.4.1** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.1.1. This release includes several fixes for the link:/docs/connectors/mongodb/[MongoDB connector] and link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector], including improved support for https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/[Amazon RDS] and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora (MySQL compatibility)]. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics on these changes. 

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.4` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Jan, Horia, David, Josh, Johan, Sanjay, Saulius, and everyone in the community for their help with this release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== What's next

Kafka 0.10.2.0 is out, so we plan to release 0.5.0 next week with all of the changes/fixes in 0.4.1 but with support for Kafka 0.10.2.0. We'll then continue to improve the MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL connectors and pushing out 0.5.x releases. Stay tuned and get involved!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
