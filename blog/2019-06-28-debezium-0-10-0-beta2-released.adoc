It's my pleasure to announce the release of Debezium *0.10.0.Beta2*!

This further stabilizes the 0.10 release line, with lots of bug fixes to the different connectors.
https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.10.0.Beta2[23 issues] were fixed for this release;
a couple of those relate to the DDL parser of the MySQL connector,
e.g. around `RENAME INDEX` (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1329[DBZ-1329]),
`SET NEW` in triggers (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1331[DBZ-1331])
and function definitions with the `COLLATE` keyword (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1332[DBZ-1332]).

For the Postgres connector we fixed a potential inconsistency when flushing processed LSNs to the database
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1347[DBZ-1347]).
Also the "include.unknown.datatypes" option works as expected now during snapshotting
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1335[DBZ-1335])
and the connector won't stumple upon materialized views during snapshotting any longer
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1345[DBZ-1345]).

The SQL Server connector will use much less memory in many situations
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1065[DBZ-1065])
and it's configurable now whether it should emit tombstone events for deletions or not
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-835[DBZ-835]).
This also was added for the Oracle connector, bringing consistency for this option across all the connectors.

Note that this release can be used with Apache Kafka 2.x, but not with 1.x.
This was an unintentional change and compatibility with 1.x will be restored for the Beta3 release
(the issue to track is https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1361[DBZ-1361]).

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
