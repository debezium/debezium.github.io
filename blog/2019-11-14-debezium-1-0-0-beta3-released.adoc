While fall weather is in full swing, the Debezium community is not letting the unusually low, frigid temperatures get the best of us.  It is my pleasure to announce the release of Debezium *1.0.0.Beta3*!

This new Debezium release includes several notable new features, enhancements, and fixes:

* Built against Kafka Connect 2.3.1 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1612[DBZ-1612])
* Renamed `drop_on_stop` configuration parameter to `drop.on.stop` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1595[DBZ-1595])
* Standardized source information for Cassandra connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1408[DBZ-1408])
* Propagate MongoDB replicator exceptions so they are visible from Kafka Connect's status endpoint (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1583[DBZ-1583])
* Envelope methods should accept `Instant` rather than `long` values for timestamps (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1607[DBZ-1607])
* Erroneously reporting no tables captured (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1519[DBZ-1519])
* Avoid Oracle connector attempting to analyze tables (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1569[DBZ-1569])
* Toasted columns should contain `null` in _before_ rather than `__debezium_unavailable_value` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1570[DBZ-1570])
* Support PostgreSQL 11+ `TRUNCATE` operations using `pgoutput` decoder (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1576[DBZ-1576])
* PostgreSQL connector times out in schema discovery for databases with many tables (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1579[DBZ-1579])
* Value of `ts_ms` is not correct duing snapshot processing (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1588[DBZ-1588])
* Heartbeats are not generated for non-whitelisted tables (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1592[DBZ-1592])

Additionally there were improvements to the Docker container images to reduce their overall size and some build infrastructure improvements to apply automatic code formatting rules.  Details about code formatting changes can be found in the https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md#code-formatting[CONTRIBUTE.md] file.

In total, this release contains link:/releases/1.0/release-notes/#release-1.0.0-beta3[27 changes].

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
