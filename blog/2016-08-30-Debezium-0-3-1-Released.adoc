We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.1** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains an updated link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector] with a handful of bug fixes and two significant but backward-compatible changes. First, the MySQL connector now supports using secure connections to MySQL, adding to the existing ability to connect securely to Kafka. Second, the MySQL connector is able to capture MySQL string values using the proper character sets so that any values stored in the database can be captured correctly in events. See our link:/docs/releases/#release-0-3-1[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Chris, Akshath, barten, and and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
