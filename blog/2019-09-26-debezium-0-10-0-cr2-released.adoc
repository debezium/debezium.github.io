I'm very happy to announce the release of Debezium *0.10.0.CR2*!

After the CR1 release we decided to do another candidate release, as there was not only a good number of bug fixes coming in, but also a few very useful feature implementations were provided by the community, which we didn't want to delay.
So we adjusted the original plan a bit and now aim for Debezium 0.10 Final in the course of next week,
barring any unforeseen regressions.

As usual, let's take a closer look at some of the new features and resolved bugs.

== Customizable Message Keys

Being able to configure which columns of a table should go into the key of corresponding Kafka messages has been a long-standing feature request (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1015[DBZ-1015]).
To recap, by default the message key of Debezium's data change events will contain the primary key column(s) of the represented table.
That's a sensible default, but sometimes more flexibility is desirable:

* Some tables don't have a primary key, esp. in legacy data models
* Choosing a different message key than the primary key may facilitate stream processing applications that operate on multiple change data topics

The second case is especially of interest when building https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/[Kafka Streams] applications that join multiple CDC topics:
in general, topic joins can only be done if the message key is the same on both sides of the join.

For instance let's assume we have two tables, `Customer` and `CustomerDetails` with different primary keys and a foreign key relationship from `CustomerDetails` to `Customer`.
By choosing that foreign key column as the message key for customer detail change events,
the two table streams could be joined without the need for re-keying the customer details topic.
To do so, the new `message.key.columns` option can be used like so:

[source]
----
message.key.columns=dbserver1.inventory.customerdetails:CustomerId
----

Customizable message keys are supported for all the relational Debezium connectors.

== Pluggable Serializers for Cassandra

From previous announcements you might remember that Debezium's Cassandra connector is a bit different from the other ones,
as it's not based on the Kafka Connect framework.
As such, until now it didn't support the notion of configurable message serializers;
Avro was the only supported message format.

As part of the ongoing efforts to align the Cassandra connector more closely with the other ones,
it now allows to configure different serializers, so you also could use JSON, ProtoBuf and other formats (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1405[DBZ-1405]).
The serializer framework from Kafka Connect is reused for that, so you can leverage all the existing serializers and configure them exactly the same way as done for any other connector.

== Improved handling of Postgres TOAST Columns

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html[TOAST columns] are a mechanism in Postgres for dealing with column values that exceed the page size limit (typically 8 KB).
While the usage of TOAST is transparent when interacting with the database itself,
this is not the case when obtaining change events via logical decoding.
As TOASTed values are not stored within the physical data row itself,
logical decoding does not expose the value of *unchanged* TOAST columns
(unless the column is part of the table's replica identity).

This situation used to be handled in different ways by the the logical decoding plug-ins supported by Debezium (`pgoutput`, `decoderbufs` and `wal2json`),
one approach being the retrieval of such column "out of bands".

Unfortunately, there's no way for savely doing this when considering concurrent writes to such record.
So we reworked how TOAST columns are handled:
if a TOAST column's value hasn't changed and that column isn't part of the table's replica identity, its value will not be contained in `UPDATE` or `DELETE` events.
Instead, a configurable marker value will be exported in this case
(defaulting to `__debezium_unavailable_value`).

This avoids the race conditions that were possible before, but of course raises the question how consumers should deal with this marker value.
There are multiple possible answers to that:

* The value could simply be ignored; for instance a consumer that writes change events to a database, may omit that column from the `UPDATE` statement it issues
* When not working with dynamic updates, a trigger may be installed in a sink database,
that ignores any updates that would set a column value to the marker, keeping the previous value
* When actually requiring complete change events including any TOAST column within the Kafka change data topic itself, a stateful Kafka Streams application could be built which hydrates incoming change events with the marker value based on the previous column value persisted in a state store

Thinking about it, the last approach might be an interesting topic for a future blog post :-)

== Bugfixes and Other Changes

Besides these feature implementations, this release contains a number of bugfixes, too:

* When using the `pgoutput` logical decoding plug-in for Postgres, custom publication names are supported (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1436[DBZ-1436])
* The Postgres connector will retry for a configurable period of time to obtain a replication slot, which can be helpful when rebalancing existing connectors in a cluster (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1426[DBZ-1426])
* Reserved characters in column names can be replaced when using Avro as message format (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1044[DBZ-1044])
* Default values without the time part for MySQL `DATETIME` columns are supported now (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1501[DBZ-1501])
* MySQL `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` statements with default character sets are supported (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1470[DBZ-1470])

Testing for MongoDB has been expanded to also cover version 4.2 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1389[DBZ-1389]), and the Postgres driver has been updated to the latest and greatest version 42.2.7 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1462[DBZ-1462]).
We're also happy to report that going forward, the Debezium container images are also available in the https://quay.io/[quay.io] container registry (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1178[DBZ-1178]).

Overall, not less than https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.10.0.CR2[30 issues] were fixed in the 0.10 CR2 release.

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
