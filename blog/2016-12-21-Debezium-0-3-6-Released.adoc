We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.6** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains over a dozen fixes combined for the MySQL connector and MongoDB connectors. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics on these changes. 

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Farid, RenZhu, Dongjun, Anton, Chris, Dennis, Sharaf, Rodrigo, Tim, and others for their help with this release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== What's next

We'll continue to improve the MongoDB and MySQL connectors, and we also have a great PostgreSQL connector that is nearly ready to be released. With the new connector we'll switch release numbers to 0.4.x and plan to stop issuing 0.3.x releases. Stay tuned for this next 0.4.0 release!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
