= Debezium Wears Fedora

:awestruct-tags: [ postgres, fedora, vagrant ]
:awestruct-layout: blog-post

The Debezium project strives to provide an easy deployment of connectors,
so users can try and run connectors of their choice mostly by getting the right connector archive and unpacking it into the plug-in path of Kafka Connect.

This is true for all connectors but for the http://debezium.io/docs/connectors/postgresql/[Debezium PostgreSQL connector].
This connector is specific in the regard that it requires a https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html[logical decoding plug-in] to be installed inside the PostgreSQL source database(s) themselves.
Currently, there are two supported logical plug-ins:

* https://github.com/debezium/[postgres-decoderbufs], which uses Protocol Buffers as a very compact transport format and which is maintained by the Debezium community
* https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json[JSON-based], which is based on JSON and which is maintained by its own upstream community

These plug-ins can be consumed and deployed in two ways;
the easiest one is to use one of our pre-made https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/postgres[Postgres container images],
which contain both plug-ins and are already configured as required.
If you are using containers in your datacenter, and/or if you start a fresh database from scratch,
then this can be a great option.

The other approach is building from source.
Even if this is usually an easy task, it still brings a barrier to an easy start and requires a non-trivial knowledge of the Linux operating system.

To bridge the gap between those two extremes we've created and published an https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/postgres-decoderbufs[RPM package],
available for Fedora 30 and later.
By installing this package you will have the necessary binaries deployed, and the only task remaining is to configure PostgreSQL to enable the plug-in.
The RPM is based on the latest stable Debezium release,
link:/blog/2019/05/06/debezium-0-9-5-final-released/[0.9.5.Final] at this point.

== Example

Let's show how the package works.
We will use the https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] tool as an easy way for firing up a pre-provisioned virtual machine with Fedora.
Of course, that's not a requirement and the same steps apply for any other way of running Fedora.

Create and start virtual machine with Fedora 30:

```
$ vagrant init fedora/30-cloud-base

A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

$ vagrant up

Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
.
.
.
==> default: Machine booted and ready!

```

Log into the virtual machine:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

Install the PostgreSQL server and Protocol Buffers logical decoding plug-in:

```
$ sudo dnf -y install postgresql postgres-decoderbufs
.
.
.

Complete!

```

Next, initialize the database:

```
$ sudo /usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb
```

Now enable the plug-in in the database server configuration file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf` by adding the following parameters:

```
# MODULES
shared_preload_libraries = 'decoderbufs'

# REPLICATION
wal_level = logical             # minimal, archive, hot_standby, or logical (change requires restart)
max_wal_senders = 8             # max number of walsender processes (change requires restart)
wal_keep_segments = 4           # in logfile segments, 16MB each; 0 disables
#wal_sender_timeout = 60s       # in milliseconds; 0 disables
max_replication_slots = 4       # max number of replication slots (change requires restart)
```

Configure the security file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` for the database user that will be used by Debezium (e.g. `debezium`) by adding these parameters:

```
local   replication     debezium                          trust
host    replication     debezium  127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     debezium  ::1/128                 trust
```

Finally, restart PostgreSQL:
```
$ sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

And that's it:
Now we have a PostgreSQL database, that is ready to stream changes to the Debezium PostgreSQL connector.
Of course, the plug-in can also be installed to an already existing database (Postgres versions 9 and later),
just by installing the RPM package and setting up the config and security files in the described way.

== Outlook: pgoutput

While the decoderbufs plug-in is our recommended choice for a logical decoding plug-in,
there are cases where you may not be able to use it.
Most specifically, you typically don't have the flexibility to install custom plug-ins in cloud-based environments such as Amazon RDS.

This is why we're exploring a https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-766[third alternative] to decoderbufs and wal2sjon right now,
which is to leverage Postgres logical replication mechanism.
There's a built-in plug-in, _pgoutput_ based on this, which exists in every Postgres database since version 10.
We're still in the process of exploring the implications (and possible limitations) of using _pgoutput_,
but so far things look promising and it may eventually be a valuable tool to have in the box.

Stay tuned for more details coming soon!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams,
so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems.
Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running,
ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.
Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
