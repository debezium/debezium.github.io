I'm happy to announce that **Debezium 0.2.4 is now available** for use with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1. This release adds more verbose logging during MySQL snapshots, enables taking snapshots of very large MySQL databases, and correct a potential exception during graceful shutdown. See our link:/docs/releases#release-0-2-4[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with label `0.2` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial[tutorial].

Thanks to David and wangshao for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
Stay tuned for our next release, which will be 0.3 and will have a new MongoDB connector and will support Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1.

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
