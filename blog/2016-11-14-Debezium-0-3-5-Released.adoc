We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.5** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains several fixes for the MySQL connector and adds the ability to use with link:/docs/mysql/#multi-master-mysql/[multi-master MySQL servers] as sources. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics on these changes. We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

One of the fixes is signficant, and so *we strongly urge all users to upgrade to this release from all earlier versions.* In prior versions, the MySQL connector may stop without completing all updates in a transaction, and when the connector restarts it starts with the _next_ transaction and therefore might fail to capture some of the change events in the earlier transaction. This release fixes this issue so that when restarting it will always pick up where it left off, even if that point is in the middle of a transaction. Note that this fix only takes affect once a connector is upgraded and restarted. See https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-144[the issue] for more details.


Thanks to Akshath, Anton, Chris, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!

== About Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases. Debezium is built on top of http://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] and provides http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, so your application can be stopped and restarted at any time and can easily consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely. Debezium is link:/license/[open source] under the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License, Version 2.0].
