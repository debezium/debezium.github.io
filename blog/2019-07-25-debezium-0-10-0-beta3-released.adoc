The summer is at its peak but Debezium community is not relenting in its effort so the Debezium *0.10.0.Beta3* is released.

This version not only continues in incremental improvements of Debezium but also brings new shiny features.

All of you who are using PostgreSQL 10 and higher as a service offered by different cloud providers definitely felt the complications when you needed to deploy logical decoding plugin necessary to enable streaming.
This is no longer necessary. Debezium now supports (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-766[DBZ-766]) https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/protocol-logical-replication.html[pgoutput] replication protocol that is available out-of-the-box since PostgreSQL 10. 

There is a set of further minor improvements.
The tombstones for deletes are configurable for all connectors now (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1365[DBZ-1365]).
Also tables without primary keys are now supported for all connectors (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-916[DBZ-916]).
This further reduces the gap between old and new connectors capabilities.

There are improvements for heartbeat system.
Heartbeat messages now contain the timestamp (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1363[DBZ-1363]) of when they were created in their body.
The new messages are properly skipped by the Outbox router (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1388[DBZ-1388]).
MySQL connector additionally uses heartbeats for `BinlogReader` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1338[DBZ-1338]).
MongoDB connector now utilizes heartbeats too (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1198[DBZ-1198]).

As we now that metrics are very important for keeping Debezium happy in production we have extended the set of supported metrics.
A new metric count of events in error (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1222[DBZ-1222]) is added so it is easy to monitor any non-standards in processing.
Database history recovery can take a long time during startup so it is now possible to monitor the progress of it (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1356[DBZ-1356]).

The other changes include updating of Docker images to use Kafka 2.3.0 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1358[DBZ-1358]).
PostgreSQL supports lockless snapshotting (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1238[DBZ-1238]) and Outbox router now  process delete messages (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1320[DBZ-1320]).

We continue with stabilization of the 0.10 release line, with lots of bug fixes to the different connectors.

Multiple defects in MySQL parser have been fixed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1398[DBZ-1398], (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1397[DBZ-1397], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1376[DBZ-1376]) and `SAVEPOINT` statements are no longer recorded in database history (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-794[DBZ-794]).  

Under certain circumstances, it was possible that PostgreSQL connector lost the first event while switching to streaming from the snapshot (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1400[DBZ-1400]).
