== Articles

Gunnar Morling recently attended Kafka Summit in London where he gave a talk on Change Data Streaming Patterns
for Microservices With Debezium.  You can watch the full presentation https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-lon19/change-data-streaming-patterns-microservices-debezium[here].

Strimzi provides an easy way to run Apache Kafka on Kubernetes or Openshift.  https://medium.com/@sincysebastian/setup-kafka-with-debezium-using-strimzi-in-kubernetes-efd494642585[This article]
by Sincy Sebastian shows just how simple it is to replicate change events from MySQL to Elastic Search using Debezium.

Debezium allows replicating data between heterogeneous data stores with ease.  https://blog.couchbase.com/kafka-connect-mysql-couchbase-debezium/[This article] by Matthew Groves
explains how you can replicate data from MySQL to CouchBase.

As the size of data that systems maintain continues to grow, this begins to impact how we capture, compute, and report
real-time analytics. https://medium.com/high-alpha/data-stream-processing-for-newbies-with-kafka-ksql-and-postgres-c30309cfaaf8[This article] by Maria Patterson
explains how you can use Debezium to stream data from Postgres, perform analytical calculations using KSQL, and then
stream those results back to Postgres for consumption.

In a https://medium.com/@singaretti/streaming-de-dados-do-postgresql-utilizando-kafka-debezium-v2-d49f46d70b37[recent article] published in Portuguese,
Paulo Singaretti illustrates how they use Debezium and Kafka to stream changes from their relational database and then store
the change stream results in Google Cloud Services.

This https://debezium.io/blog/2019/05/23/tutorial-using-debezium-connectors-with-apache-pulsar/[recent blog] by Jia Zhai provides
a complete tutorial showing how to use Debezium connectors with Apache Pulsar.
