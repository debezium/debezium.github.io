## Contribute to Debezium's website

Our website is a community effort, and we welcome suggestions, fixes, improvements, and even new blog posts related to Debezium. The website is statically generated from [source code](https://github.com/debezium/debezium.io) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap). This document outlines the basic steps require to get the latest source code for the website, modify it, test it locally, and create pull requests. And, yes, this process is intentionally very similar to how we [contribute code](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTE.md).

### Talk to us

You can talk to us in our [chat room for developers](https://gitter.im/debezium/dev) or on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/debezium). We do [track our issues for the website](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20component%20%3D%20website), so please report any problems or suggestions even if you're going to propose a fix. No issue is required for new blog posts, though.

### Get set up

Before you can work on the website, you first need to get everything set up.

#### Install the tools

The following software is required to work with the Debezium website and build it locally:

* [Git 2.2.1](https://git-scm.com) or later
* [Docker Engine 1.9](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or later

See the links above for installation instructions on your platform. You can verify the versions are installed and running:

    $ git --version
    $ docker --version

#### GitHub account

Debezium uses [GitHub](GitHub.com) for its primary code repository and for pull-requests, so if you don't already have a GitHub account you'll need to [join](https://github.com/join).

#### Fork the Debezium website repository

Go to the [Debezium repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io) and press the "Fork" button near the upper right corner of the page. When finished, you will have your own "fork" at `https://github.com/<your-username>/debezium.github.io`, and this is the repository to which you will push your proposed changes and create pull requests. For details, see the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

#### Clone your fork

Next, you need to get the code onto your local machine. At a terminal, go to the directory in which you want the code, and run the following command to use HTTPS authentication:

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/debezium.github.io.git

If you prefer to use SSH and have [uploaded your public key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/), you can instead use SSH:

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/debezium.github.io.git

This will create a `debezium.github.io` directory, so change into that directory:

    $ cd debezium.github.io

This repository knows about your fork, but it doesn't yet know about the official or ["upstream" Debezium.io repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io). Run the following commands:

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io.git
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/develop develop

Now, when you check the status using Git, it will compare your local repository to the *upstream* repository.

### Get the latest upstream code

You will frequently need to get all the of the changes that are made to the upstream repository, and you can do this with these commands:

    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git pull upstream develop

The first command fetches all changes on all branches, while the second actually updates your local `develop` branch with the latest commits from the `upstream` repository.

### Build and make changes

This section goes into detail about how you can build and edit the website locally using Docker, and how you can submit the changes via pull requests.

#### Building locally

To build the source code locally, checkout and update the `develop` branch:

    $ git checkout develop
    $ git pull upstream develop

Then use Docker to run a container that initializes the Jekyll tooling. Start a new terminal, configure it with the Docker environment (if required), and run the following command:

    $ docker run --privileged -it --rm -p 4000:4000 -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 -e LANG=C.UTF-8 -v $(pwd):/site debezium/website-builder setup
    
*Note:* Some times you may wish to use the `root` user of your linux machine to run docker (as docker needs elevated privileges to run). It's probably a better idea to run docker containers while [running as a user other than root and using sudo](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-run-docker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel/) or adding the [user to the group that has privileges](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/docker/docker-installation.html) to run docker. When you checkout the code for this project don't clone the source code and try running this command as the `root` user. When you do this, all of the code (and the entire folder) then gets owned by the `root` user. The reason why this is undesirable is when we run `docker run -v $(pwd):/site` we are actually mounting the local file system where the source code lives _into_ the docker container. If this directory is owned by `root`, the image cannot create the necessary directories for running `rake` and `bundle`.     

This should download all of the Ruby Gems the tooling uses, as defined in the `Gemfile` file. After it completes, run a container using the same image but with a different command:

    $ docker run --privileged -it --rm -p 4000:4000 -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 -e LANG=C.UTF-8 -v $(pwd):/site debezium/website-builder bash

This command will start a container using the `debezium/jekyll` Docker image, first downloading the image if necessary. It also mounts the current directory (where the website code is located) into the container's `/site` directory. 

Next, at the command line of that container run the following command:

    /site$ rake clean preview

This cleans up any previously-generated files in the `_site` directory, (re)generates the files for the website, and runs a local webserver to access the site by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:4000]().

Note: With documentation maintained in the main Debezium code repository you may want to edit documentation locally and review how it renders prior to committing changes.  In order to use author mode, two things must be done:

1. The docker container must have an additional volume mapped that points to the main Debezium repository that you've checked out locally.  In this example, we've checked out the https://github.com/debezium/debezium repository to `~/github/debezium`.  So in order to map that directory as a volume on the docker container, you will additionally need to provide the argument `-v ~/github/debezium:/debezium` when starting the container.  Below is an example of how it should look:

        $ docker run --privileged -it --rm -p 4000:4000 -e LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 -e LANG=C.UTF-8 -v $(pwd):/site -v ~/github/debezium:/debezium debezium/website-builder bash
        
      When inside the docker container, you should notice a `/debezium` directory now exists and its contents is that of the checked out repository.  In the event you do not see a `/debezium` directory or that its contents are empty or incorrect, please review how you mapped the volume above.
      
2. By default the rake command uses the remote repository checkout method, which means any changes locally that are staged and uncommitted are not going to be included.  In order to activate author mode, the `author` command line argument should be passed to rake, as shown below:

        /site$ rake clean author preview
        
      You want to make sure that you see the following output that confirms its using author-mode.  
      
        Generating Antora documentation using configuration: playbook_author.yml
        
      If it reports that its using `playbook.yml` instead, then author mode was not properly requested and you should check how you invoked rake.                     

Note: If you're running Docker on Windows or OS X, you must use [port forwarding](https://debezium.io/docs/docker#port-forwarding) so that requests get forwarded properly to the Docker host virtual machine. For example, to port forward when using a Vagrant based VM (virtualbox, etc), you can port forward the `4000` port easily like this:


    vagrant ssh -- -vnNTL *:4000:$DOCKER_HOST_IP:4000    

#### Changing the source

You can edit and change the source files at any time. For small modifications, Jekyll will often recognize the changes and then regenerate the affected static pages. However, this recognition may not work for additions, deletions, or even larger modifications. In this case, use CTRL-C to stop the Jekyll webserver in the Docker container, and rerun the same command:

    /site$ rake clean preview

#### Committing changes

Before you make any changes, be sure to switch to the `develop` branch and pull the latest commits on the `develop` branch from the upstream repository. Also, it's probably good to run a build and verify all tests pass *before* you make any changes.

    $ git checkout develop
    $ git pull upstream develop
    $ mvn clean install

Once everything builds, create a *topic branch* named appropriately (we recommend using the issue number, such as `DBZ-1234`):

    $ git checkout -b DBZ-1234

This branch exists locally and it is where you should make all of your proposed changes for the issue. As you'll soon see, it will ultimately correspond to a single pull request that the Debezium committers will review and merge (or reject) as a whole.

Feel free to commit your changes locally as often as you'd like, though we generally prefer that each commit represent a complete and atomic change to the code. Committing is as simple as:

    $ git commit .

which should then pop up an editor of your choice in which you should place a good commit message. _*We do expect that all commit messages begin with a line starting with the JIRA issue and ending with a short phrase that summarizes what changed in the commit.*_ For example:

    DBZ-1234 Corrected typo on community page.

Make sure you didn't break any other part of the website. 

#### Rebasing

If its been more than a day or so since you created your topic branch, we recommend *rebasing* your topic branch on the latest `develop` branch. This requires switching to the `develop` branch, pulling the latest changes, switching back to your topic branch, and rebasing:

    $ git checkout develop
    $ git pull upstream develop
    $ git checkout DBZ-1234
    $ git rebase develop

If your changes are compatible with the latest changes on `develop`, this will complete and there's nothing else to do. However, if your changes affect the same files/lines as other changes have since been merged into the `develop` branch, then your changes conflict with the other recent changes on `develop`, and you will have to resolve them. The git output will actually tell you you need to do (e.g., fix a particular file, stage the file, and then run `git rebase --continue`), but if you have questions consult Git or GitHub documentation or spend some time reading about Git rebase conflicts on the Internet.

### Creating a pull request

Once you're finished making your changes, your topic branch should have your commit(s) and you should have verified that your branch builds successfully. At this point, you can shared your proposed changes and create a pull request. To do this, first push your topic branch (and its commits) to your fork repository (called `origin`) on GitHub:

    $ git push origin DBZ-1234

Then, in a browser go to https://github.com/debezium/debezium.io, and you should see a small section near the top of the page with a button labeled "Create pull request". GitHub recognized that you pushed a new topic branch to your fork of the upstream repository, and it knows you probably want to create a pull request with those changes. Click on the button, and GitHub will present you with a short form that you should fill out with information about your pull request. The title should start with the JIRA issue and ending with a short phrase that summarizes the changes included in the pull request. (If the pull request contains a single commit, GitHub will automatically prepopulate the title and description fields from the commit message.) 

When completed, press the "Create" button and copy the URL to the new pull request. Go to the corresponding JIRA issue and record the pull request by pasting the URL into the "Pull request" field. (Be sure to not overwrite any URLs that were already in this field; this is how a single issue is bound to multiple pull requests.) Also, please add a JIRA comment with a clear description of what you changed. You might even use the commit message (except for the first line).

At this point, the Debezium committers will be notified of your new pull request, and will review it in short order. They may ask questions or make remarks using line notes or comments on the pull request. (By default, GitHub will send you an email notification of such changes, although you can control this via your GitHub preferences.)

If the reviewers ask you to make additional changes, simply switch to your topic branch for that pull request:

    $ git checkout DBZ-1234

and then make the changes on that branch and either add a new commit or ammend your previous commits. When you've addressed the reviewers' concerns, push your changes to your `origin` repository:

    $ git push origin DBZ-1234

GitHub will automatically update the pull request with your latest changes, but we ask that you go to the pull request and add a comment summarizing what you did. This process may continue until the reviewers are satisfied.

By the way, please don't take offense if the reviewers ask you to make additional changes, even if you think those changes are minor. The reviewers have a broach understanding of the codebase, and their job is to ensure the code remains as uniform as possible, is of sufficient quality, and is thoroughly tested. When they believe your pull request has those attributes, they will merge your pull request into the official upstream repository.

Once your pull request has been merged, feel free to delete your topic branch both in your local repository:

    $ git branch -d DBZ-1234

and in your fork: 

    $ git push origin :DBZ-1234

(This last command is a bit strange, but it basically is pushing an empty branch (the space before the `:` character) to the named branch. Pushing an empty branch is the same thing as removing it.)

### Site characteristics

When you build the site, the Jekyll tools will generate all of the static files for the site and place them into a local `_site` directory. These are the only files that will appear on the public website.

### Common changes

Some changes to the website are fairly common, so they're described here.

#### Add a blog post

Anyone can write a blog post that is related to Debezium. Simply add a new AsciiDoc file to the `_posts` directory, including the date in the filename using the same format as the other files (e.g., "2016-03-18-title-of-blog-post.adoc"). The file should also contain jekyll front matter like the following:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  Title of Blog Post
    date:   yyyy-mm-dd
    tags: [ tag1, tag2 ]
    author: theAuthor
    ---

The author is the key to an entry in the `_data/authors.yaml` file, so the first time be sure to add an entry for yourself (avatar images go in the `assets/images` directory). Specify the appropriate lowercase tags, surrounding multi-word tags with double quotes.

Then, rebuild the site and make sure your post is formatted correctly and appears in the [blog](https://debezium.io/blog/).

#### Software release process
   
   __New release in existing `<major>.<minor>` series__
   - Write a blog post announcing the release
   - Add a new yml file for the release under the appropriate `_data\releases\<major>.<minor>` directory.  For example `_data\releases\1.0\1.0.0.Final.yml`
   - Update the release notes in `releases\<major>.<minor>\release-notes.asciidoc`
   
   __New `<major>.<minor>` release__
   - Write a blog post announcing the release
   - Add the new `<major>.<minor>` version to the end of the `_data\versions.yml` file.
   - Create a new directory under `_data\releases` - for example for a 1.0 release, add directory `_data\releases\1.0`
   - Add a new yml file for the release under the appropriate `_data\releases\<major>.<minor>` directory.  For example `_data\releases\1.0\1.0.0.Final.yml`
   - Create a `series.yml` file: `_data\releases\<major>.<minor>\series.yml` **(described in the next section)**
   - Create a new directory under `releases` - for example for a 1.0 release, add directory `releases\1.0`
   - Create and update `index.asciidoc` and `release-notes.asciidoc` under the `releases\<major>.<minor>` directory.

##### Series YAML

The `series.yml` file describes an overview of the entire series.  For `1.0.0.Alpha1` the `series.yml` would look like:

```yaml
summary: Version 1.0
displayed: true
hidden: false
compatibility:
  java:
    version: 8+
  connect:
    version: 1.x, 2.x
  mysql:
    database:
      versions:
        - 5.7
        - 8.0.13
    driver:
      versions:
        - 8.0.13
  mongodb:
    database:
      versions:
        - 3.2
        - 3.4
        - 3.6
        - 4.0
    driver:
      versions:
        - 3.11.1
  postgresql:
    database:
      versions:
        - 9.6
        - 10
        - 11
        - 12
    driver:
      versions:
        - 42.2.9
  sqlserver:
    database:
      versions:
        - 2017
        - 2019
    driver:
      versions:
        - 7.2.2.jre8
  oracle:
    database:
      versions:
        - 11g
        - 12c
    driver:
      versions:
        - 12.2.0.1  
  cassandra:
    database:
      versions: 
        - 3.11.4
    driver:
      versions:
        - 3.5.0         
```  

The `summary` attribute describes a brief overview/highlight of changes in this series.

The contents under _compatibility_ are meant to reflect what this version was tested with.
If new compatibility types are added, be sure to update the `_config.yml` file under `integrations` accordingly.
For non-connector entries, specifying the compatibility-type and its associated version string is sufficient.
For connector entries, specify the `database -> versions` and `driver -> versions` arrays accordingly.

_Note that since a series.yml file describes a release series and not a specific bugfix release, the contents of the file should reflect what the latest test compatibility is for the most recent release within the series._
_So as new releases are added to a given series, its important to update the series.yml file with the pertinent connector and driver tested versions_.

The _hidden_ attribute describes whether or not the series should be exposed on the website at all.   In general, when a series is considered legacy/old and no longer relevant, this attribute can be set to _true_ and no reference to this version will be included in the jekyll output.

The _displayed_ attribute describes whether or not the series is considered _active_.  On the Releases Overview, we render boxes for all displayed (e.g. active) series.  There is a subsection that is hidden initially for older releases.  If _hidden=false_ and _displayed=false_, then that series will show up under the "Show Older Series" button.

_As new series are added, the older `series.yml` files may need to be updated and their `hidden=true` set to keep the rendered content appropriate for the release-based views._

##### Version-specific YAML

This file describes a specific version.  For `1.0.0.Alpha1` the file would be called `_data\releases\1.0\1.0.0.Alpha1.yml` and would look like:

```yaml
date: 2019-05-29
stable: false
summary: First alpha release for 0.10 - Code cleanup
announcement_url: `/blog/2019/05/29/debezium-0-10-0-alpha1-released/`
```

The `date` attribute is written in a `yyyy-mm-dd` format and should be the date when the release was published.

The `stable` attribute describes whether or not the version is considered stable.  This is generally set to `true` for example when releasing the _Final_ equivalent of a release.

The `summary` describes a brief overview of the changes in this specific release.

The `announcement_url` is the relative URL to the blog post about the release.

##### Update playbook attributes

When a new stable release has been published, be sure to update `playbook.yml` and `playbook_author.yml` files and set the `page-version-current` asciidoc variable to the most recent stable version identified by the `version` attribute from the main repository's `antora.yml` descriptor (see Antora Version in the table below).

At the time of writing the following table illustrates the mappings:

|Branch|Debezium Version|Antora Version|
|---|---|---|
|master|1.2.x|master|
|1.2|1.2.x|1.2|
|1.1|1.1.x|1.1|
|1.0|1.0.x|1.0|
|0.9|0.9.x|0.9|

At the time of writing this, 1.2 has not yet been published as _Final_ and therefore the `page-version-current` asciidoc attribute in the playbook files should reference the Antora Version value of `1.1`.
Once version 1.2.0.Final has been released, the playbooks should reference `1.2`.

##### Updating release documents

Be sure when a new major/minor release is added that a new `releases/<major>.</minor>` directory is created and contains an `index.asciidoc` and `release-notes.asciidoc`.  See prior version directories for examples.  Update `release-notes.asciidoc` for each release.

#### Edit documentation

Documentation for Debezium is now split between this repository and the [main codebase](https://www.github.com/debezium/debezium.git) repository.  Please see [DOCUMENTATION.md](http://www.github.com/debezium/debezium/tree/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) in the main codebase repository for details about Antora and how the documentation should be updated.

Note: There are two Antora playbook configuration files used by this repository, `playbook.yml` and `playbook_author.yml`.  It is important that these two files be kept in sync and the only difference between them should be `content.sources[0].url` which controls how each playbook obtains a reference to the Debezium main code repository.  

#### Update the front page

The site's main page is defined in `/index.md`, which utilizes `_layouts/index.html` layout.

### Summary

Here's a quick check list for a good pull request (PR):

* Discussed and approved on IRC or the mailing list
* A JIRA associated with your PR (include the JIRA issue number in commit comment)
* One commit per PR
* One feature/change per PR
* No changes not directly related to your change (e.g. no formatting changes or refactoring to existing code, if you want to refactor/improve existing code that's a separate discussion and separate JIRA issue)
* A full build completes succesfully
* Do a rebase on upstream `develop`
