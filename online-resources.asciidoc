A compilation of blog posts, slide sets, recordings and other online resources around Debezium.
Most of the resources are in English; you can find a collection of link:#non_english_resources[resources in other languages] like Portuguese or French towards the end of this page.

You've written or spoken about Debezium and would like to have your post or talk listed here?
That's great, let us know by sharing the link in our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/debezium[forum].
Or better yet, just add the link to the https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io/blob/develop/docs/online-resources.asciidoc[source of this page] yourself and send a pull request against the https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io[debezium.github.io] repo.
Thanks!
