[[release-2.1.1-final]]
== *Release 2.1.1.Final* _(December 22nd 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12400296[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.3.1 and has been tested with version 3.3.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.1.1.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.1.1.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.1.1.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

MongoDB Debezium connector required streaming from primary node in the cluster.
This is no longer necessary and the connector prefers reading from non-primary node (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4339[DBZ-4339]).

Vitess Debezium connector now supports snapshotting.
This means that upon new connector start the existing content will be snapshotted by default (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5930[DBZ-5930]).



=== New features

* Implement support for JSON_TABLE in MySQL parser https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3575[DBZ-3575]

See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.1.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.1.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.1.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

The Cassandra range tombstone information was a plain string.
Now logical object with parsed data and types is provided (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5912[DBZ-5912]).

The Cassandra TimeUUID datatype was propadagated as binary object but documented as string.
This was incorrect and it is now propagated as string (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5923[DBZ-5923]).



=== New features

* Postgres: Disable LSN confirmation to database https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5811[DBZ-5811]

[[release-2.1.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.1.0.Alpha2* _(November 30th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12398904[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.3.1 and has been tested with version 3.3.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.1.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.1.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.1.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium REST extension was not deployed in Debezium container and has to be added by the user.
This is no longer necessary as the REST expension is included (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4303[DBZ-4303]).

Debezium images were upgraded to use Fedora 37 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5461[DBZ-5461]).

PostgreSQL connector could resume streaming from re-created replication slot even if it no longer contained data that connector has not seen.
The result could be a silent data loss.
Now the connector checks if the resume point is present and fails to start if it is not (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5739[DBZ-5739]).



=== New features

* Expose Cassandra Connector via Debezium Server https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2098[DBZ-2098]

[[release-2.1.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.1.0.Alpha1* _(November 10th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12397585[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.3.1 and has been tested with version 3.3.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.1.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.1.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same (when upgrading from the same major version) or updated (when upgrading from an older major version) configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.1.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].
