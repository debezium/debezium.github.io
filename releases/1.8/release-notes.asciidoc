[[release-1.8.1-final]]
== *Release 1.8.1.Final* _(February 9th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12382291[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.0.0 and has been tested with version 3.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.8.1.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.8.1.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.8.1.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

There were changes to the format of the Infinispan cache to support the storage of certain large object (LOB) events.
If you use the Infinispan buffer cache implementation and enabled LOB support, the cache files must be deleted and a new snapshot taken due to these compatibility changes (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4366[DBZ-4366]).

The Debezium container images for Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect contain the log4j 1.x library, which is a runtime dependency of Kafka (it is not used in any way by Debezium).
Several vulnerabilities were recently reported against some classes contained in that library.  While these classes are used by neither Kafka (Connect) nor Debezium, the class files _org/apache/log4j/net/JMSSink.class_, _org/apache/log4j/jdbc/_, and _/org/apache/log4j/chainsaw/_ have been removed from the log4j 1.x JAR shipped with these container images as a measure of caution.
If you actually need these classes, you should obtain the original log4j 1.x JAR and add this via custom images you derive from the Debezium ones.  We advise against doing this though as per aforementioned vulnerabilities (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4568[DBZ-4568]).

=== Breaking changes

The incubating SMT for extracting the new document state from MongoDB (link to https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/mongodb-event-flattening.html) change events propagates the document's id within a field named `_id` within the change event value (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4413[DBZ-4413]).
This is to avoid collisions with existing other document fields with the previously used name `id`.


=== New Features

* Allow to configure custom Hibernate user types for Quarkus outbox extension https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3552[DBZ-3552]
* Create a Debezium schema generator for Debezium connectors (initial work) https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4393[DBZ-4393]

=== Breaking changes

The Debezium connector for Vitess exposes a new attribute, "keyspace", in the "source" block of emitted change events (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4412[DBZ-4412]).

Vitess connector: The mapping for UINT64 columns has been changed from INT64 to String, so as to avoid a value overflow for values larger than 2^63 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4403[DBZ-4403]).

The source block structure of change events emitted by the incubating Debezium connector for Vitess has been adjusted (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4428[DBZ-4428]):

* The obsolete attribute "schema" has been removed
* The attribute "db" is now always empty; the keyspace from which a change event originated, can be retrieved via the new "keyspace" attribute

[[release-1.8.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 1.8.0.Alpha2* _(November 11th, 2021)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12377154[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.8.0 and has been tested with version 2.8.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.8.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.8.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.8.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Previous versions stored buffered events in an Infinispan cache as a part of transaction data that could lead to memory issues upon load.
This version separates transaction metadata and buffered events in different caches so the data is not loaded with transaction metadata processing (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4159[DBZ-4159]).
