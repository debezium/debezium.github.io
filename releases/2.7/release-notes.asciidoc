[[release-2.7.0-final]]
== *Release 2.7.0.Final* _(June 28th 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12429396[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.7.0 and has been tested with version 3.7.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.7.0.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.7.0.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.7.0.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].

=== Breaking changes

PostgreSQL 10 and 11 are end of life for one or more years.
Debezium now supports both versions as best effort only.

The community contributions will be accepted (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7128[DBZ-7128]).

=== Breaking changes

Debezium snapshots were orginally being deployed to the legacy `oss.sonatype.org` Sonatype infrastucture.
This has changed and they are now deployed to the new `s01.oss.sonatype.org` infrastructure (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7641[DBZ-7641]).

Oracle `NUMERIC` type with zero scale ignored `decimal.handling.mode` setting.
With this version the type is properly propagated as configured type.
This can cause an issue with upgrade for deployments with strict schema registry compatibility rules (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7882[DBZ-7882]).

[[release-2.7.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.7.0.Alpha1* _(April 25th 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12425451[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.7.0 and has been tested with version 3.7.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.7.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.7.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

JDBC queries could hang indefinitely in case of database error communication.
A configurable timeout was introduced to prevent the issue (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7616[DBZ-7616]).

SQL Server connector by default processed all transactions available during each data poll.
This could lead to out of memeory errors for databases with a large traffic.
The default value was changed to limit the number of transactions to `500` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7750[DBZ-7750]).
