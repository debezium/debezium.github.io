[[release-0-7-5]]
== *Release 0.7.5* _(March 20th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12337159[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.1 and has been tested with version 1.0.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.5 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.5 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.5 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The MySQL connector in Debezium 0.7.3 and 0.7.4 was creating database history topic with an infinite time-based log retention but a broker default one for topic size log retention.
This was fixed in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-663[DBZ-663].
See our https://debezium.io/blog/2018/03/16/note-on-database-history-topic-configuration/[blogpost] for more details,
in particular how you should adjust your database history topic configuration, if you're affected by this issue.

MySQL snapshot JMX metrics were removed after the snapshot was completed.
This was changed in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-640[DBZ-640] and the metrics are available till next connector restart.

=== New Features

This release includes the following new features:

* Keep SnapshotReaderMetrics bean registered after snapshot completed https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-640[DBZ-640]
* Cache replaced topic names and shard ids in ByLogicalTableRouter SMT https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-655[DBZ-655]
* Filter out useless commands from the history topic https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-661[DBZ-661]
* Apache Kafka 1.0.1 updates https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-647[DBZ-647]

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes:

* io.debezium.text.ParsingException for TokuDB table https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-646[DBZ-646]
* MongoDB connector continues to try to connect to invalid host even after deletion https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-648[DBZ-648]
* Streaming stopped due to JsonParseException https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-657[DBZ-657]
* 'ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE KEY key_name (colname)' throwing exception https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-660[DBZ-660]
* Missing setting for the automatic history topic creation https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-663[DBZ-663]
* EmbeddedEngine passes time of last commit to policy, not time since https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-665[DBZ-665]

=== Other changes

This release includes also other changes:

* "snapshot" attribute should be false instead of null for events based on the binlog https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-592[DBZ-592]
* Describe limitations of wal2json version currently used on RDS https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-619[DBZ-619]

[[release-0-7-4]]
== *Release 0.7.4* _(March 7th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12336214[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.0 and has been tested with version 1.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.4 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.4 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.4 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

`NUMERIC` and geo-spatial schema types were optional regardless of database column configuration. This was fixed in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-635[DBZ-635].

PostgresSQL decoder plug-in now uses text to transfer decimal values instead of double - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-351[DBZ-351].
Debezium is backward compatible with the old version.
It is thus necessary first to upgrade Debezium and after that upgrade logical decoder plug-in.


=== New Features

This release includes the following new features:

* Provide MySQL snapshot mode that does not require table locks https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-602[DBZ-602]
* Add support for columns of type "bytea" https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-605[DBZ-605]

* Support CREATE TABLE statements with PARTITION ... ENGINE=InnoDB https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-641[DBZ-641]
* Document VariableScaleDecimal in PG connector docs https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-631[DBZ-631]
* Propagate schema validator by passing AvroValidator instance instead of Function<String, String> https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-626[DBZ-626]
* Move MAX_QUEUE_SIZE, MAX_BATCH_SIZE and POLL_INTERVAL_MS to CommonConnectorConfig https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-628[DBZ-628]
* Unify common start-up logic across connectors https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-630[DBZ-630]
* Removing unused code from database history classes https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-632[DBZ-632]

=== Fixes

This release includes the following fixes:

* Numeric datatype is transferred with lost precision https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-351[DBZ-351]
* Cannot Serialize NaN value(numeric field) in Postgres https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-606[DBZ-606]
* Decimal datatype DDL issues https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-615[DBZ-615]
* Avoid NPE if confirmed_flush_lsn is null https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-623[DBZ-623]
* REAL column values are omitted if value is an exact integer https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-625[DBZ-625]
* Fix intermittent error in BinlogReaderIT https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-629[DBZ-629]
* Schema for NUMERIC and geo-spatial array columns shouldn't be optional by default https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-635[DBZ-635]
* Fix typo in README of debezium/connect-base image https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-636[DBZ-636]
* Avoid repeated creation of Envelope schema https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-620[DBZ-620]

first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.3 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.3 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

A new namespace for parameters was https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-576[created] - `internal` - that is used for parameters that are not documented and should not be used as they are subject of changes without warning.
As a result of this change the undocumented parameter `database.history.ddl.filter` was renamed to `internal.database.history.ddl.filter`.

OpenShift deployment now uses templates and images from [Strimzi project](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-545).

[[release-0-7-0]]
== *Release 0.7.0* _(December 15th, 2017)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12335366&projectId=12317320[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.0.0 and has been tested with version 1.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.7.0 from any of the earlier 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.7.0 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.7.0 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes the following changes that can affect existing installations:

* Change default setting for BIGINT UNSIGNED handling https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-461[DBZ-461];
`UNSIGNED BIGINT` is treated by default as `int64`, not as `Decimal` before. Set `bigint.unsigned.handling.mode` if you need to continue with the original behaviour.
* Invalid value for HourOfDay ConnectException when the value of MySQL TIME filed is above 23:59:59 https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-342[DBZ-342]; The default mapping for MySQL TIME(0-3) columns has changed. Such columns can store values from -838:59:59.000000 to 838:59:59.000000, which cannot be stored as milliseconds in an int32 field (the previous default mapping).
Hence the default mapping has changed to int64 and the semantic type io.debezium.time.MicroTime, i.e. values represent microseconds. +
If you prefer to keep the previous mapping (which only should be done if it's guaranteed that no values are stored in that column whose milliseconds value exceeds int32), you can do so by specifying the connector option time.precision.mode=adaptive (see the connector documentation for further details). +
This change does not affect other connectors.
* Postgres connectors stops to work after concurrent schema changes and updates https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-379[DBZ-379]; PostgreSQL connector was using JDBC metadata to get additional type information when it was processing logical events.
This could lead to a race condition when database schema was updated and Debezium was still processing events with old schema structure. +
To mitigate the problem a new version of https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs[Protocol Buffers decoder plugin] was introduced that passes additional type metadata with each event.
The connector is backward compatible with the old decoder plugin (using the original approach) but we strongly recommend to upgrade it to the latest one as soon as possible. +
The race condition issue can still happen when primary key structure is changed for the table as this information is still obtained from JDBC metadata.
To properly handle primary key change you should follow the rules
** Application should be placed in a _read-only_ mode, not writing any new data actively
** PostgreSQL connector must consume all remaining events from the database
** Primary key change is executed
** Application can switch back to regular mode
* Hardcoded schema version overrides schema registry version https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-466[DBZ-466]; The schema version returned for CDC message values (schema type dbserver1.inventory.customers.Envelope) has changed. While always `1` was returned in earlier versions, the schema version as managed by the schema registry will be returned in case the Avro serializer/deserializer is used. `Null` will be returned when using the JSON serializer/deserializer. Note that the schema version is only set during Avro message serialization, i.e. an SMT applied on the source side will also get null when querying for the schema version, as SMTs will be applied before the serialization.
