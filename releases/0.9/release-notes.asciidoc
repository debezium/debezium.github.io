[[release-0-9-5-final]]
== *Release 0.9.5.Final* _(May 2nd, 2019)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12341657[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.2.0 and has been tested with version 2.2.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.9.5.Final from any of the earlier 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.9.5.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.9.5.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

A potential https://github.com/shyiko/mysql-binlog-connector-java/pull/260[race condition] was identified in upstream library for MySQL's binary log processing.
The problem exhibits as the issue https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-1132[DBZ-1132].
If you are affected by it we propose as the workaround to increase Kafka Connect configuration options `task.shutdown.graceful.timeout.ms` and `connect.rebalance.timeout.ms`.
If the problem persists please disable keepalive thread via Debezium configration option `connect.keep.alive`.

[[release-0-9-0-beta2]]
== *Release 0.9.0.Beta2* _(December 19th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12339976[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.1.0 and has been tested with version 2.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.9.0.Beta2 from any of the earlier 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.9.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.9.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The link:/docs/configuration/mongodb-event-flattening/[MongoDB CDC Event Flattening] transformation now by default removes deletion messages (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-563[DBZ-563]).
