[[release-0.10.0-final]]
== *Release 0.10.0.Final* _(October 2nd, 2019)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12339267(complete list of issues).

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.3.0 and has been tested with version 2.3.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.10.0.Final from any of the earlier 0.10.x, 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.10.0.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.10.0.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The data type MicroDuration for representing INTERVAL columns (as supported by the Postgres and Oracle connectors) has been changed to use int64 rather than float64.
The reason being that there are no fractional microseconds values expected.
For cases where the microseconds of an interval would overflow `int64`, there'll be an alternative String-based mapping be provided in a future Debezium release, which will allow to exactly represent interval values based on their year, month, day etc. parts (see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1498[DBZ-1498]).

The behavior of unchanged TOASTed columns has changed in this release (see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1367[DBZ-1367]).
Please upgrade the PostgreSQL connector in conjunction with the Decoderbufs plugin to guarantee that these columns are handled correctly.
Please refer to the PostgreSQL connector https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/postgresql.html#toasted-values[documentation] for more information on unchanged TOASTed columns.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.10.0.Beta1 from any of the earlier 0.10.x, 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.10.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.10.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.
