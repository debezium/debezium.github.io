[[release-2.0.1-final]]
== *Release 2.0.1.Final* _(December 7th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12397603[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.3.1 and has been tested with version 3.3.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.1.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.1.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.0.1.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].

=== Breaking changes

PostgreSQL transaction id is 32-bit integer and gets rolled over.

=== Breaking changes

Default behaviour for `schema.name.adjustment.mode` is now `none`.

[[release-2.0.0-beta2]]
== *Release 2.0.0.Beta2* _(September 16th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12392459[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.2.1 and has been tested with version 3.2.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.0.Beta2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the new configuration parameter names.
Upon restart, the 2.0.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Object sizes for memory queue limits are no longer calculated using reflection but estimated based on message schema. This is not supported for Cassandra connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2766[DBZ-2766]).

All schemas used by Debezium are now defined in a central point, properly named and versioned (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4365[DBZ-4365], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5044[DBZ-5044]). This can lead to schema compatibility issues if a schema registry is used.

The connector parameter naming was overhauled and separated into distinct trees. The connector configuration must be updated (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5043[DBZ-5043]).


Most Debezium connectors now restart by default when an exception related to communication (SqlException, IOException) is thrown (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5244[DBZ-5244]).

The `skipped.operations` configuration option now defaults to truncate `t` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5497[DBZ-5497]).

Java 17 is no longer supported for writing tests. As some of the developer tools have issues when different Java level is used for main and test code, Debezium now uses Java 11 for the whole codebase (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5568[DBZ-5568]).

[[release-2.0.0-beta1]]
== *Release 2.0.0.Beta1* _(July 26th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12391139[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.2.0 and has been tested with version 3.2.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.0.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium previously exposed connector metrics as a single tuple of snapshot, streaming, and history-based beans.
With this release, connector metrics have migrated to a multi-partition scheme, which means that the naming and how metrics are exposed has changed as a part of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4726[DBZ-4726].
Please be sure to review your metrics gathering processes if you're using tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or other JMX metrics gathering frameworks.

Debezium previously provided support for reading and storing offsets, history, and other bits as a part of the `debezium-core` module.
With this release, we've introduced a new module called `debezium-storage` with implementations for _local file_ and _Kafka_ based storage approaches (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5229[DBZ-5229]).
This approach provides a wonderful extension point going forward to introduce other storage implementations as the need arises.
When upgrading, you may need to adjust your application's dependencies depending on what storage module implementations your code depends upon.

[[release-2.0.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.0.0.Alpha2* _(June 9th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12385341[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.2.0 and has been tested with version 3.2.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.0.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium MySQL connector represented `FLOAT` datatype as `FLOAT64`.
Now the correct type `FLOAT32` is used (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-3865[DBZ-3865]).

MongoDB connector no longer supports streaming from `oplog`.
The connector fully switched to change streams streaming (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4951[DBZ-4951]).

All connectors now use multi-partitioned codebase.
This has impact only on project developers (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5042[DBZ-5042]).

All deprecated configuration options were removed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5045[DBZ-5045]).

[[release-2.0.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.0.0.Alpha1* _(April 28th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12377386&version=12380203[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.1.0 and has been tested with version 3.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.0.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Java 11 is required to run Debezium in any form: Kafka Connect plug-in, Debezium engine and Debezium Server (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4949[DBZ-4949]).

Maven 3.8.4 is required to build Debezium (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5064[DBZ-5064]).

PostgreSQL connector no longer supports old versions of `protobuf` decoding plug-in that do not have transaction and default value support (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-703[DBZ-703]).

PostgreSQL connector no longer supports `wal2json` decoding plug-in (dehttps://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4156[DBZ-4156]).
`pgoutput` decoding plug-in is recommended as the replacement.

Legacy implementation of MySQL connector was removed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4950[DBZ-4950]).

Confluent Avro converters are no longer present in ebezium container images (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4952[DBZ-4952]).

JDBC legacy date/time properties support was removed from MySQL connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4965[DBZ-4965]).
