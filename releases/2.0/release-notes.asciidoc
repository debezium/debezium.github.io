[[release-2.0.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.0.0.Alpha1* _(April 28th 2022)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12377386&version=12380203[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.1.0 and has been tested with version 3.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.0.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.0.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.0.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Java 11 is required to run Debezium in any form: Kafka Connect plug-in, Debezium engine and Debezium Server (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4949[DBZ-4949]).

Maven 3.8.4 is required to build Debezium (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5064[DBZ-5064]).

PostgreSQL connector no longer supports old versions of `protobuf` decoding plug-in that do not have transaction and default value support (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-703[DBZ-703]).

PostgreSQL connector no longer supports `wal2json` decoding plug-in (dehttps://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4156[DBZ-4156]).
`pgoutput` decoding plug-in is recommended as the replacement.

Legacy implementation of MySQL connector was removed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4950[DBZ-4950]).

Confluent Avro converters are no longer present in ebezium container images (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4952[DBZ-4952]).
