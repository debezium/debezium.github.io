[[release-2.4.0-beta1]]
== *Release 2.4.0.Beta1* _(August 29th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12411390[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.5.1 and has been tested with version 3.5.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.4.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.4.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.4.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

Oracle SCN metrics were exposed as strings.
This could prevent ceratin tools like JMX exporter from scraping them.
Debezium currently exposes them as numerc `BigInteger` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6798[DBZ-6798]).

[[release-2.4.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.4.0.Alpha2* _(August 9th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12410665[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.5.1 and has been tested with version 3.5.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.4.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.4.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.4.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium Server package provided only Cassandra 4 connector.
All connectors are now provided but an environment variable must be configured to select the one to use (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6638[DBZ-6638]).

MySQL did not set precision for `BIGINT` in precise mode.
The precision is now set which can lead to a schema incompatibility (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6714[DBZ-6714]).

Default value for default Oracle LogMiner query fetch size was increase to `10000` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6729[DBZ-6729]).

Vitess connector mapped `_bin` collated string columns to binary data.
The columns are now correctly mapped to strings (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6748[DBZ-6748]).

Vitess connector previously applied schema changes across all shards.
The schema changes are now correctly applied for each shard individually (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6775[DBZ-6775]).
If you are using a `io.debezium.schema.DefaultTopicNamingStrategy` (or a derivative) then you should switch to `io.debezium.connector.vitess.TableTopicNamingStrategy` to preserve the same topics. Now the `DefaultTopicNamingStrategy` will route messages to topics based on which shard the change occurred in.

[[release-2.4.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.4.0.Alpha1* _(July 14th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12409716[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.5.0 and has been tested with version 3.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.4.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.4.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.4.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

MongoDB connector interanlly used primary preferred hard-coded behaviour in certain scenarios.
This is no longer the case and the connection string seting is used (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6521[DBZ-6521]).

Vitess connector source info now contains the shard that was the source of the event (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6617[DBZ-6617]).
