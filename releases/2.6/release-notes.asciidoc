[[release-2.6.0-final]]
== *Release 2.6.0.Final* _(April 2nd 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12425282[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.7.0 and has been tested with version 3.7.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.6.0.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.6.0.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.6.0.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].

=== Breaking changes

SQL Server by mistake did not honor `store.only.captured.tables` setting on the first connector start.
This is rectified and the connector by default takes the snapshot of all table schemas (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7593[DBZ-7593]).

Vitess connector origninally used the timestamp of `BEGIN` message as the source timestamp.
This has been changed to the usage of the `COMMIT` timestamp to reflect the behaviour of othe connectors (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7628[DBZ-7628]).

Debezium MySQL connector is upgraded to 8.3.0 JDBC driver.
This driver is no longer compatible with MySQL 5.
If you still need to use older MySQL versions please downgrade the driver after the installation (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7652[DBZ-7652]).

[[release-2.6.0-beta1]]
== *Release 2.6.0.Beta1* _(March 6th 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12423016[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.7.0 and has been tested with version 3.7.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.6.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium Oracle connector required manual installation of Oracle JDBC driver.
This is no longer needed as the driver is packaged into the connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7364[DBZ-7364]).

The handling of `MAVEN_DEP_DESTINATION` environment has changed in `connect-base` container image.
It is no longer used for downloading all dependencies including connectors but only for general purpose Maven Central located dependencies (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7551[DBZ-7551]).

[[release-2.6.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.6.0.Alpha2* _(February 13rd 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12419774[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.6.1 and has been tested with version 3.6.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.6.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.6.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.6.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

In 2.6, the task config format for Vitess connector was changed because the previous approach could de-stabilize Kafka Connect cluster (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7250[DBZ-7250]).
In some cases, when upgrading this change will cause `NullPointerException` and the error `Couldn't instantiate task <task-id> because it has an invalid task configuration. This task will not execute until reconfigured.`.
To fix this, delete & recreate each connector, using the same name & config.
The connector(s) will start up and reuse the offsets last stored since they are using the same connector name (but will not try to reuse old task configs, which causes the error).


=== New features

[[release-2.6.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 2.6.0.Alpha1* _(January 18th 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12416463[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.6.1 and has been tested with version 3.6.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.6.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.6.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.6.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

MongoDB no longer supports `replica_set` connection mode (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7260[DBZ-7260]).

Re-select columns post-processor used for the key defined by `message.key.columns` for query building.
This is not correct for most tables with primary key.
The default behaviour has changed and the table primary key is used by default.
A new configuration option was introduced to allow user to choose is primary key or generated key should be used (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7358[DBZ-7358]).
