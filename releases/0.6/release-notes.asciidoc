[[release-0-6-2]]
== *Release 0.6.2* _(November 15th, 2017)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12335989&projectId=12317320[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 0.11.0.1 and has been tested with version 0.11.0.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.6.2 from any of the earlier 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.6.2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.6.2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

* Timestamp field not handle time zone correctly https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-260[DBZ-260]

[[release-0-6-0]]
== *Release 0.6.0* _(September 21st, 2017)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12331386&projectId=12317320[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 0.11.0.0 and has been tested with version 0.11.0.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.6.0 from any of the earlier 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.6.0 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.6.0 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release includes the following change that affects existing installations that capture MongoDB:

* Add support for different MongoDB id types in key struct https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-306[DBZ-306];
the key payload continues to be a string in all cases, but it will be created using MongoDB's extended JSON serialization (strict mode).
So e.g. an int key will result in a key payload such as `{ "id" : "1234" }`, a String key will yield `{ "id" : "\"1234\"" }` and an `ObjectId` key will yield `{ "id" : "{\"$oid\" : \"596e275826f08b2730779e1f\"}" }`.
This allows to restore the key into the correct type from the serialized representation.
Note that the id field has been renamed from "_id" into "id".
This is to be consistent with the format used by the other Debezium connectors;
also it allows you to tell apart messages written by earlier Debezium versions from messages written by 0.6 and beyond.

=== New Features

This release includes the following new features:

* Use new Kafka 0.10 properties for listeners and advertised listeners https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-39[DBZ-39]
* Add docker-compose handling for Debezium tutorial https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-127[DBZ-127]
