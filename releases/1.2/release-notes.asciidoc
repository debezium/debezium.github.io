[[release-1.2.0-beta2]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Beta2* _(May 19th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12345708[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.5.0 and has been tested with version 2.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.0.Beta2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.2.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The snapshot mode `initial_schema_only` was renamed `schema_only` for Db2 connector (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2051[DBZ-2051]).

The previously deprecated options `operation.header` and `add.source.fields` of the `ExtractNewRecordState` have been removed; please use `add.headers` and `add.fields` instead (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1828[DBZ-1828]).

When instantiating the Debezium container in integration tests with Testcontainers, the full image name must be given now, e.g. 1debezium/connect:1.2.0.Beta2`.
This is to allow for using custom container images in tests, e.g. containing additional SMTs, converters or sink connectors (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2070[DBZ-2070]).

[[release-1.2.0-beta1]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Beta1* _(May 7th, 2020)_

=== Breaking changes

Field `eventType` was removed from Outbox router SMT (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2014[DBZ-2014]).

JDBC driver has been upgrade to the version to 42.2.12 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2027[DBZ-2027]). Due to changes in the driver behaviour it is necessary to keep Debezium and driver versions aligned.

Debezium API now allows conversion to JSON and Avro types distinctly for key and value (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1970[DBZ-1970]). To enable this feature it was necessary to modify the incubating Debezium API.

[[release-1.2.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Alpha1* _(April 16th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12344691[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.4.1 and has been tested with version 2.4.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

For the SQL Server connector, the previously deprecated snapshot mode `initial_schema_only` has been removed.

The previously deprecated message transformations `UnwrapFromEnvelope` and `UnwrapMongoDbEnvelope` have been removed.
