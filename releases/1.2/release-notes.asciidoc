[[release-1.2.5-final]]
== *Release 1.2.5.Final* _(September 24th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12350624[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.5.0 and has been tested with version 2.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.5.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.5.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.2.5.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.

=== New Features

There are no new features in this release.

* Swap closing square bracket for curly brace in downstream title annotations https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2577[DBZ-2577]



[[release-1.2.4-final]]
== *Release 1.2.4.Final* _(September 17th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12347255[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.5.0 and has been tested with version 2.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The SMTs for content-based routing and filtering – both using JSR 223 scripting engines for script evaluation – have been moved from the Debezium core module into a separate artifact (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2549[DBZ-2549]).
This must be added to the plug-in directories of those connector(s) for which you wish to use those SMTs.
When using the Debezium container image for Kafka Connect, set the environment variable `ENABLE_DEBEZIUM_SCRIPTING` to `true` in order to do so.
This change was done so to allow for exposing scripting functionality only in environments with an appropriately secured Kafka Connect configuration interface.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The format of whitelist/blacklist filter expressions for the Oracle connector has changed: the database name is not to be given as part of these any longer (the reason being that each connector only ever is configured in the scope of exactly one database).
Filters like _ORCLPDB1.SOMESCHEMA.SOMETABLE_ must be adjusted to _SOMESCHEMA.SOMETABLE_.
The same applies for configuration properties referencing specific table columns, such as `column.propagate.source.type`.

The format of whitelist/blacklist filter expressions for the SQL Server connector has changed: the database name is not to be given as part of these any longer (the reason being that each connector only ever is configured in the scope of exactly one database).
Filters like _testDB.dbo.orders_ must be adjusted to _dbo.orders_.
The old format still is supported, but should not be used any longer and will be de-supported in a future version.
The same applies for configuration properties referencing specific table columns, such as `column.propagate.source.type`.

[[release-1.2.0-beta2]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Beta2* _(May 19th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12345708[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.5.0 and has been tested with version 2.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.0.Beta2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.2.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The snapshot mode `initial_schema_only` was renamed `schema_only` for Db2 connector (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2051[DBZ-2051]).

The previously deprecated options `operation.header` and `add.source.fields` of the `ExtractNewRecordState` have been removed; please use `add.headers` and `add.fields` instead (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1828[DBZ-1828]).

When instantiating the Debezium container in integration tests with Testcontainers, the full image name must be given now, e.g. 1debezium/connect:1.2.0.Beta2`.
This is to allow for using custom container images in tests, e.g. containing additional SMTs, converters or sink connectors (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2070[DBZ-2070]).


=== New Features

* Add JDBC driver versions to docs https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2031[DBZ-2031]
* Add a few more loggings for Cassandra Connector https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2066[DBZ-2066]

[[release-1.2.0-beta1]]

=== Breaking changes

Field `eventType` was removed from Outbox router SMT (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2014[DBZ-2014]).

JDBC driver has been upgrade to the version to 42.2.12 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2027[DBZ-2027]). Due to changes in the driver behaviour it is necessary to keep Debezium and driver versions aligned.

Debezium API now allows conversion to JSON and Avro types distinctly for key and value (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1970[DBZ-1970]). To enable this feature it was necessary to modify the incubating Debezium API.

[[release-1.2.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Alpha1* _(April 16th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12344691[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.4.1 and has been tested with version 2.4.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

For the SQL Server connector, the previously deprecated snapshot mode `initial_schema_only` has been removed.
The mode `schema_only` should be used instead, providing the same behavior and semantics (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1945[DBZ-1945]).

The previously deprecated message transformations `UnwrapFromEnvelope` and `UnwrapMongoDbEnvelope` have been removed.
Instead, please use `ExtractNewRecordState` and `ExtractNewDocumentState`, respectively (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1968[DBZ-1968]).
