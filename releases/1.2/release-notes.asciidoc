[[release-1.2.0-beta1]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Beta1* _(May 7th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12345561[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.5.0 and has been tested with version 2.5.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.2.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

Field `eventType` was removed from Outbox router SMT (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2014[DBZ-2014]).

JDBC driver has been upgrade to the version to 42.2.12 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2027[DBZ-2027]). Due to changes in the driver behaviour it is necessary to keep Debezium and driver versions aligned.

[[release-1.2.0-alpha1]]
== *Release 1.2.0.Alpha1* _(April 16th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12344691[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.4.1 and has been tested with version 2.4.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.2.0.Alpha1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.2.0.Alpha1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.2.0.Alpha1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

For the SQL Server connector, the previously deprecated snapshot mode `initial_schema_only` has been removed.
The mode `schema_only` should be used instead, providing the same behavior and semantics (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1945[DBZ-1945]).

The previously deprecated message transformations `UnwrapFromEnvelope` and `UnwrapMongoDbEnvelope` have been removed.
Instead, please use `ExtractNewRecordState` and `ExtractNewDocumentState`, respectively (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1968[DBZ-1968]).
