[[release-3.0.0-cr1]]
== *Release 3.0.0.CR1* _(September 13rd 2024)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12432262[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.8.0 and has been tested with version 3.8.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 3.0.0.CR1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 3.0.0.CR1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 3.0.0.CR1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

JMX signalling and notification did not work correctly for deployments with SQL Server configured for multiple tasks.
To fix the issue it was necessary to change the naming of signalling and notification MBeans to make them unique per each task (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-8137[DBZ-8137]).

Deprecated Oracle connector configuration options were removed from the project (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-8181[DBZ-8181]).

Vector datatype names introduced for PostgreSQL were too related to PostgreSQL datatype naming.
The type names were changed to more generic ones and are shared between PostgreSQL and MySQL (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-8183[DBZ-8183]).

=== Breaking changes

Debezim Kafka sink could wait indefinitely in case of Kafka broker unavailablity.
A support for configurable timeout was added and the default behaviour is timeout after 30 seconds (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7575[DBZ-7575]).

RabbitMQ native stream sink was sending changes all messages into a static single stream.
With the new default behaviour the changes are sent to a distinct stream for each table (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-8118[DBZ-8118]).
