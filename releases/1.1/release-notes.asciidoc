[[release-1.1.0-cr1]]
== *Release 1.1.0.CR1* _(March 11th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12344727[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.4.0 and has been tested with version 2.4.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Cassandra or DB2 connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.1.0.CR1 from any of the earlier 1.1.x, 1.0.x, 0.10.x, 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.1.0.CR1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.1.0.CR1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The default value of MySQL config option `gtid.new.channel.position` was originally set to `latest` that should never be used in a production. The default value was thus set to `earliest` and the config option is scheduled for removal (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1705[DBZ-1705]).
The MySQL config option `event.deserialization.failure.handling.mode` was renamed to `event.processing.failure.handling.mode` to make the naming consistent with other connectors (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1826[DBZ-1826]).
MongoDB config option `field.renames` adds renamed field (wtih `null value`) even when the source field is missing.
This was identified as a defect and the non-present fields are no longer added (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1848[DBZ-1848]).

=== Breaking changes

Before updating the DecoderBufs logical decoding plug-in in your Postgres database to this new version (or when pulling the debezium/postgres container image for that new version), it is neccessary to upgrade the Debezium Postgres connector to 1.0.1.Final or 1.1.0.Alpha2 or later (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1052[DBZ-1052]).

The `ExtractNewDocumentState` SMT to be used with the Debezium MongoDB connector will convert `Date` and `Timestamp` fields now into the `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Timestam`p logical type, clarifying its semantics.
The schema type itself remains unchanged as `int64`.
Please note that the resolution of `Timestamp` is seconds as per the semantics of that type in MongoDB. (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1717[DBZ-1717]).

* Create a plug-in for DB2 streaming https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-695[DBZ-695]

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.1.0.Alpha1 from any of the earlier 1.1.x, 1.0.x, 0.10.x, 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

When using the outbox event routing SMT and configuring a column from which to obtain the Kafka record timestamp from (table.field.event.timestamp option), then that value could have been exported as milliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds, based on the source column's definition.
As of this release, the timestamp always be exported as milliseconds (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1707[DBZ-1707]).

The deprecated Postgres connector option `slot.drop_on_stop` has been removed; use `slot.drop.on.stop` instead (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1600[DBZ-1600]).
