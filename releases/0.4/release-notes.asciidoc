[[release-0-4-1]]
== *Release 0.4.1* _(March 17, 2017)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12333486[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been tested with Kafka Connect 0.10.1.1 (or a subsequent API-compatible release), and is known to be _incompatible_ with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.x due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3006[binary incompatible changes in the Kafka 0.10.0 API]. See https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-80[DBZ-80] for details, and Kafka documentation for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.4.1 from any of the earlier 0.4.0, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions, first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using. Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.4.1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration. Upon restart, the 0.4.1 MySQL connectors will continue where the previous connector left off. As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

=== Breaking changes

This release has no breaking changes since the link:release-0-4-0[previous] release.

=== New Features

This release adds/improves to the MySQL connector preliminary support for https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/[Amazon RDS] and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora (MySQL compatibility)] (see https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-140[DBZ-140]).
