[[release-2.5.0-final]]
== *Release 2.5.0.Final* _(December 21st 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12416251[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.6.1 and has been tested with version 3.6.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.5.0.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.5.0.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.5.0.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

MongoDB default connection mode is changed from `replica_set` to `sharded` as a preparation step for its complete removal.
The change will lead to invalidation of existing offsets and a silent re-execution of the initial snapshot.
To prevent this a check was added that will fail the connector upon start if this would happen.
The user can either set `replica_set` connection mode explicitly or can remove the existing offsets (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7272[DBZ-7272]).


=== New features

* Support persistent history for snapshot requests for the kafka signal topic. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7164[DBZ-7164]
* Change metrics endpoint of Connect REST Extensions to use the MBeanServerv directly instead of HTTP calls to the Jolokia endpoint https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7177[DBZ-7177]
* Metrics endpoint must handle connectors with multiple tasks (SQL Server) https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7178[DBZ-7178]
* Add configuration option to CloudEventsConverter to customize schema type name https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7235[DBZ-7235]

* Leaking JDBC connections https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7275[DBZ-7275]
* IncrementalSnapshotCaseSensitiveIT#insertDeleteWatermarkingStrategy fails https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7276[DBZ-7276]

[[release-2.5.0-cr1]]
== *Release 2.5.0.CR1* _(December 14th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12416252[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.6.1 and has been tested with version 3.6.1 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.5.0.CR1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.5.0.CR1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.5.0.CR1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

The schema name prefix and letter casing for Cloud Event headers was not consistent with payload name.
The schema name was aligned so both headers and payload share th same namespace and follow the same rules for letter casing (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7216[DBZ-7216]).

MySQL `BIT` datatype did not have an implicit length if any was not set.
This is incorrect as the default length if none is provided is `1` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7230[DBZ-7230]).



=== New features

* Explore BLOB support via re-selection https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-4321[DBZ-4321]

* Upgrade  Kafka to 3.6.1 and ZooKeeper to 3.8.3 https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7238[DBZ-7238]


=== Fixes

* Oracle abandoned transaction implementation bug causes OoM https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7236[DBZ-7236]
* Add Grammar Oracle Truncate Cluster https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7242[DBZ-7242]

* Broken support for multi-namespace watching  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7254[DBZ-7254]


=== Other changes

* Add tracing logs to track execution time for Debezium JDBC connector  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7217[DBZ-7217]
* Validate & clarify multiple archive log destination requirements for Oracle https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7218[DBZ-7218]

first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.5.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.5.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

MongoDB no longer allows doing collection snapshot on a specific shard in sharded deployment.
This was never intended and supported feature and was removed as a step in complete replica set streaming mode removal (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7139[DBZ-7139]).

`ComputePartition` SMT was deprecated and replaced with significantly improved `PartitionRouting` SMT.
The original SMT is now completely removed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7141[DBZ-7141]).

JDBC Sink connector was storing default values in database columns when `null` value was streamed and such value existed.
This was incorrect behaviour and is now fixed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7191[DBZ-7191]).



=== New features

[[release-2.5.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.5.0.Alpha2* _(November 10th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12415492[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.6.0 and has been tested with version 3.6.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.5.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].


=== Breaking changes

MySQL 5.7 is end of life.
Debezium is no longer officially supporting it or testing with it.
Further support is on best-effort basis only (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6874[DBZ-6874]).

Configuration option `metadata.location` was renamed to `metadata.source` for CloudEvents converter (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7060[DBZ-7060]).

MongoDB default connection mode is switched from `replica_set` to `sharded`.
This is the first step in removing the `replica_set` mode completely.
Please note that the offsets will be invalidated and snapshot triggered for existing deployments unless the configuration option is explicitly set (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7108[DBZ-7108]).

Using deprecated embbeded engine API is no longer possible.
Only Debezium Engine API is available (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7110[DBZ-7110]).
