[[release-1.3.0-beta1]]
== *Release 1.3.0.Beta1* _(August 28th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12346874[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.6.0 and has been tested with version 2.6.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.3.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.3.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.3.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

Certain configuration options (\*.whitelist/*.blacklist) could be perceived as promoting racial stereotypes.
These options now use a new naming convention: (\*.include.list/*.exclude.list) (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2171[DBZ-2171]).
This change is now implemented for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and SQL Server connectors, and the other connectors will follow in the next release.
It is still possible to use the old names to simplify the migration but a warning is generated upon using the obsolete names.

The deprecated option will be removed in a future Debezium release. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2400[DBZ-2400])
