[[release-1.3.1-final]]
== *Release 1.3.1.Final* _(November 12th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12350845[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.6.0 and has been tested with version 2.6.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.3.1.Final from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.3.1.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.3.1.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

[[release-1.3.0-cr1]]
== *Release 1.3.0.CR1* _(September 24th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12350459[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.6.0 and has been tested with version 2.6.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.3.0.CR1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.3.0.CR1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.3.0.CR1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The SMTs for content-based routing and filtering – both using JSR 223 scripting engines for script evaluation – have been moved from the Debezium core module into a separate artifact (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2549[DBZ-2549]).
This must be added to the plug-in directories of those connector(s) for which you wish to use those SMTs.
When using the Debezium container image for Kafka Connect, set the environment variable `ENABLE_DEBEZIUM_SCRIPTING` to `true` in order to do so.
This change was done so to allow for exposing scripting functionality only in environments with an appropriately secured Kafka Connect configuration interface.


=== New Features

* Describe configurations options for auto-created change data topics https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-78[DBZ-78]


=== Fixes

* Outbox | Heartbeat not working when using ByteBufferConverter https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2396[DBZ-2396]
* Catch up streaming before snapshot may duplicate messages upon resuming streaming https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2550[DBZ-2550]
* Fix Quarkus datasource configuration for Quarkus 1.9 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2558[DBZ-2558]


=== Other changes

* Show custom images instead of S2I in docs https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2236[DBZ-2236]
* Add Db2 tests to OpenShift test-suite and CI  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2383[DBZ-2383]

* Format updates in doc for topic routing and event flattening SMTs https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2554[DBZ-2554]
* Coordinate docs work for downstream 1.3 release https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2557[DBZ-2557]

[[release-1.3.0-beta2]]
== *Release 1.3.0.Beta2* _(September 16th, 2020)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12347109[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.6.0 and has been tested with version 2.6.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.3.0.Beta1 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.3.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.3.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

Certain configuration options (\*.whitelist/*.blacklist) could be perceived as promoting racial stereotypes.
These options now use a new naming convention: (\*.include.list/*.exclude.list) (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-2462[DBZ-2462]).
This change should now be implemented for all connectors.
It is still possible to use the old names to simplify the migration but a warning is generated upon using the obsolete names.
