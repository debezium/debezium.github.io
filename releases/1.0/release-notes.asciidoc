[[release-1.0.0-beta1]]
== *Release 1.0.0.Beta1* _(October 17th, 2019)_

See the https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12339267[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.3.0 and has been tested with version 2.3.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL or SQL Server connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.0.0.Beta1 from any of the earlier 0.10.x, 0.9.x, 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.0.0.Beta1 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.0.0.Beta1 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

The ExtractNewDocumentState and EventRouter SMTs now propagate any heartbeat or schema change messages unchanged instead of dropping them as before. This is to ensure consistency with the ExtractNewRecordState SMT (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1513[DBZ-1513]).

The new Postgres connector option `interval.handling.mode` allows to control whether `INTERVAL` columns should be exported as microseconds (previous behavior, remains the default) or as ISO 8601 formatted string (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1498[DBZ-1498]). The following upgrade order must be maintained when existing connectors capture `INTERVAL` columns:

1. Upgrade the Debezium Kafka Connect Postgres connector
2. Upgrade the logical decoding plug-in installed in the database
3. (Optionally) switch `interval.handling.mode` to string

In particular it should be avoided to upgrade the logical decoding plug-in before the connector, as this will cause no value to be exported for `INTERVAL` columns.


=== New Features

* Provide alternative mapping for INTERVAL https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1498[DBZ-1498]
* Ensure message keys have correct field order https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1507[DBZ-1507]
