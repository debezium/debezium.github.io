[[release-2.2.0-alpha2]]
== *Release 2.2.0.Alpha2* _(February 16th 2023)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12400776[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.4.0 and has been tested with version 3.4.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 2.2.0.Alpha2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 2.2.0.Alpha2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 2.2.0.Alpha2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://hub.docker.com/u/debezium[DockerHub].


=== Breaking changes

Debezium mapped non-ASCII characters into underscores in topic and schema names.
This could lead into conflicts in case of names differing with only non-ASCII characters.
Debezium now provides a strategy to map the characters uniquely.
As by-product it is no longer possible to use `sanitize.field.names` config option (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-5743[DBZ-5743]).

Debezium Server was extracted from the main repository and is now located and built from its won separate repository.
This allowed the build process to include the non-core connectors in the assembly package (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6049[DBZ-6049]).

SSN field from Oracle connector was propagated as `INT32` in the source info block.
This could lead to overflows on certain installations so the field is now propagated as `INT64` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-6091[DBZ-6091]).
