[[release-0-8-3-final]]
== *Release 0.8.3.Final* _(September 19th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version0=12339197[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.1.0 and has been tested with version 1.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.8.3.Final from any of the earlier 0.8.x, 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,
first check the upgrading notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 0.8.3.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 0.8.3.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.

* Ability to rewrite deleted records https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-857)[DBZ-857]; note this deprecates the existing "drop.deletes" link:/docs/configuration/event-flattening/#configuration_options[SMT configuration option]; instead set "delete.handling.mode" to "drop";
* use tcpKeepAlive by default https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-895)[DBZ-895]

This release includes the following fixes:

* Global read lock not release when exception raised during snapshot https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-769)[DBZ-769]

[[release-0-8-2]]
== *Release 0.8.2* _(August 30th, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12338793[complete list of issues].

Note that by accident the version of the release artifacts is _0.8.2_ instead of _0.8.2.Final_.
This is not in line with our recently established convention of always letting release versions end with qualifiers such as _Alpha1_, _Beta1_, _CR1_ or _Final_.
The next version in the 0.8 line will be _0.8.3.Final_ and we'll improve our release pipeline to make sure that this situation doesn't occur again.

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.1.0 and has been tested with version 1.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

[[release-0-8-0-beta-1]]
== *Release 0.8.0.Beta1* _(June 21st, 2018)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12337217[complete list of issues].

=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 1.1.0 and has been tested with version 1.1.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.

=== Upgrading

Before upgrading the MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL connectors, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 0.8.0.Beta1 from any of the earlier 0.7.x, 0.6.x, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x, or 0.1.x versions,

As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.

=== Breaking changes

Topic names for heartbeat messages followed a hard-coded naming schema.
The rules were made more flexible in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-668[DBZ-668].

Transaction id (`txId` field of `Envelope`) for PostgreSQL was originally encoded as an 32-bit `integer` type.
The real range is a 64-bit `long` type so this was changed in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-673[DBZ-673].

The datatypes without timezone were not correctly offsetted for databases running in non-UTC timezones.
This was fixed in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-578[DBZ-587] and https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-741[DBZ-741].
See link:docs/connectors/mysql/#temporal-values[MySQL] and link:docs/connectors/postgresql/#temporal-values[PostgreSQL] connector documentation for further details.
