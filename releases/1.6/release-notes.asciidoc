[[release-1.6.0-beta2]]
== *Release 1.6.0.Beta2* _(June 10th, 2021)_

See the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12358021[complete list of issues].


=== Kafka compatibility

This release has been built against Kafka Connect 2.7.0 and has been tested with version 2.7.0 of the Kafka brokers.
See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.


=== Upgrading

Before upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.

When you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 1.6.0.Beta2 from any earlier versions,
first check the migration notes for the version you're using.
Gracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 1.6.0.Beta2 plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.
Upon restart, the 1.6.0.Beta2 connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.
As one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.

If you are using our docker images then do not forget to pull them fresh from Docker registry.
