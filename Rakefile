# This file is a rake build file. The purpose of this file is to simplify
# setting up and using Jekyll. It's not required to use Jekyll, though it
# does save you time (hopefully). If you don't want to use rake, just ignore or
# delete this file.
#
# If you're just getting started, execute this command to install Jekyll and
# the libraries on which it depends:
#
#  rake setup
#
# The setup task installs the necessary libraries according to which Ruby
# environment you are using. If you want the libraries kept inside the project,
# execute this command instead:
#
#  rake setup[local]
#
# IMPORTANT: To install gems, you'll need development tools on your machine,
# which include a C compiler, the Ruby development libraries and some other
# development libraries as well.
#
# There are also tasks for running Jekyll. The build will auto-detect
# whether you are using Bundler and, if you are, wrap calls to Jekyll in
# `bundle exec`.
#
# To run in Jekyll in development mode, execute:
#
#  rake
#
# To clean the generated site before you build, execute:
#
#  rake clean preview
#
# To get a list of all tasks, execute:
#
#  rake -T
#
# Now you're Jekyll with rake!
